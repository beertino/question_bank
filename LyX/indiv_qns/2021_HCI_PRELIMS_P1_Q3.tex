An abstract Data Type (ADT) consists of both data type and associated
operations. 

A stack ADT has the following operations defined: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Create(S) -{}-{}- creates an empty stack S, 
\item Insert(S, Item) -{}-{}- inserts new value, Item, onto stack S, 
\item Retrieve(S) -{}-{}- removes and returns item from the stack S, 
\item EmptyStack(S) -{}-{}- returns true if stack S is empty. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Devise an algorithm that converts a non-negative integer from decimal
to hexadecimal, by making use of the stack operations given above.

\item Three items, L1, L2 and L3, are to be inserted into a stack in its
original order, but the output would be in the order of L1, L3 and
L2. 

Write an algorithm, using the operations given above, that would use
a stack R to carry this out. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
