A school database has some data in the following table: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{StudentID} & \textbf{Student Name } & \textbf{Class } & \textbf{Subjects}\tabularnewline
\hline 
1  & Wong Yong Ming  & 1917  & H2MATH, H2PHY, H2CHEM, H2ECON\tabularnewline
\hline 
2  & Vikram Singh  & 1911  & H2MATH, H2CHEM, H2ECON,H1GEOG\tabularnewline
\hline 
3  & Muhd Bashir bin Ramdan  & 1911 & H2MATH, H2CHEM, H2ECON, H1ELIT\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular} 
\par\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {}
\begin{enumerate}
\item State and explain if the above table is in third normal form (3NF).
\hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Describe two advantages that normalised data has over redundant data.
\hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
In an effort to improve the school database, the IT administrator
came up with an ER diagram. Part of the full ER diagram is as shown.

Each of the three entities in the ER diagram has a name attribute. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(b)] {}  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write table descriptions to implement the above ER diagram. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item Write an SQL query to retrieve only the student name and class name
for all students in the level \texttt{JC2}. \hfill{}{[}3{]}

A fast-growing startup is writing code to provide a new service. The
user needs have not yet been fully determined, and the data schema
is likely to undergo further changes before being finalised. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(c)]  {}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suggest if SQL or NoSQL is more suitable for the needs of this startup.
Give \textbf{two} reasons to support your answer.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
\item Describe \textbf{two} challenges the startup will face in using NoSQL
databases.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item[(d)]  The startup is concerned that a hardware failure may wipe out critical
data and leave them unable to continue operating. 

Suggest what the startup should do to \textbf{ensure} that they are
safe against data loss in such a scenario.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
