\item \textbf{{[}PJC/PRELIM/9597/2017/P1/Q1{]} }

The text file \texttt{TEMPERATURE.txt} contains the mean daily temperature
from January 1982 to June 2017. Each line of record is in the format 
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{<year>-<month> <mean daily temperature> }
\par\end{center}

For examples, \texttt{1982-01 29.8} and \texttt{2017-06 31.6} 

\subsection*{Task 1.1 }

Write program code that will 
\begin{itemize}
\item read the data from the text file, 
\item calculate the average of all the available monthly temperatures by
year, by totalling up the temperatures for each month of that year
and divided by the number of months, 
\item output the average temperature for that year (from 1982 to 2017),
in 3 decimal places.
\item Use the following format: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{}%
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\texttt{Year} &  & \texttt{Average temperature}\tabularnewline
\texttt{1982} &  & \texttt{31.442}\tabularnewline
\texttt{1983} &  & \texttt{31.750}\tabularnewline
\texttt{$\vdots$} &  & \texttt{$\vdots$}\tabularnewline
\texttt{$\vdots$} &  & \texttt{$\vdots$}\tabularnewline
\texttt{2017} &  & \texttt{31.217 }\tabularnewline
\end{tabular}\texttt{ }
\par\end{center}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Task 1.2 }

Sort by temperature and output the average temperature by year, in
ascending order of temperature. If temperatures are the same, then
display the later year before the earlier year. For example, if year
2017 and 1989 have the same temperature, then display 2017 before
1989.
