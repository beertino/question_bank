You have taken over the following program module A in an unnamed programming
language written by an unnamed intern (who did not take A-level Computing)
to determine the number of markers and their consecutive labels to
be positioned on a newly completed highway. X is the length of the
highway in kilometres. Makers should be spaced 500 metres apart from
one another.
