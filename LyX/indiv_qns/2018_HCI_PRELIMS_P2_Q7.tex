The elements of an array are numbered 0 to MAX. It is wished to copy
all the data items stored in that part of the array between START
and FINISH to a different position in the array, the item at START
moving to NEWSTART.

Describe in detail an algorithm to accomplish this. You may assume
that no items will be moved beyond the range of the array, but remember
that the copying may be in either direction, and that the new position
may overlap the old. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
