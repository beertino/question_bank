\textbf{Task 2.1}

Complete the doubly linked list class \texttt{Doubly\_LL} by implementing
both the \texttt{insert} and \texttt{delete} class functions. \hfill{}{[}10{]}
\begin{itemize}
\item The class function \texttt{insert(node)} takes a \texttt{Node} instance
\texttt{node} as input and inserts it at the tail of the linked list.
Take note that the attributes \texttt{prev} and \texttt{next} of \texttt{Node}
instance \texttt{node} are both \texttt{None} before the insertion. 
\item The class function \texttt{delete(node)} takes a \texttt{Node} instance
\texttt{node} which exists in the linked list as input. The function
removes/detaches \texttt{node} from the linked list and returns it.
The \texttt{node} returned has both its attributes \texttt{prev} and
\texttt{next} set to \texttt{None}, but data remains unchanged. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Task 2.2 }

The class \texttt{LRUQ} uses the doubly linked list class \texttt{Doubly\_LL}
to implement its least recently used queue (\texttt{lruq}). \hfill{}{[}8{]}
\begin{itemize}
\item The attribute hashmap is a dictionary object that takes the node's
data as key and the node instance itself in lruq as value. 
\item The attribute size is the max number of nodes that lruq can have.
\item The attribute count is the number of nodes that lruq currently have. 
\end{itemize}
Complete the least recently used queue class \texttt{LRUQ} by implementing
the \texttt{use} function. The class function \texttt{use(value)}
takes an integer \texttt{value} as input. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If \texttt{value} is in \texttt{lruq} (referenced by hashmap), it
removes the node in the \texttt{lruq} and re-insert it to the end
of the \texttt{lruq}. 
\item If \texttt{value} is not in \texttt{lruq} (not referenced by hashmap),
it references \texttt{value} in hashmap and inserts a new \texttt{Node}
instance with value as its data to the end of \texttt{lruq}. If \texttt{count}
> \texttt{size}, it removes the least recently used node in \texttt{lruq}
and de-references it in \texttt{hashmap}. 

Hint: To de-reference a key in \texttt{hashmap}, you can call the
following. \texttt{self.hashmap.pop(key, None)} where \texttt{self.hashmap}
is a dictionary object. 
\end{itemize}
The test function \texttt{test2\_2()} is provided for you in \texttt{task2.ipynb}.
The expected outcome of this test function is shown on the next page.
Take note that the size of the least recently used queue is \texttt{6}
in this test function.
