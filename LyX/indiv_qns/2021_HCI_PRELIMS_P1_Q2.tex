Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the unsorted
array \texttt{A{[}low..high{]}} into two halves, calls itself for
the two halves, until each half is of length 1. It then merges the
two sorted halves. An algorithm for Merge Sort is given below.

\texttt{PROCEDURE MergeSort(A, low, high) }

\texttt{\qquad{}IF low < high }

\texttt{\qquad{}\qquad{}mid \textleftarrow{} (low + high) DIV 2 }

\texttt{\qquad{}\qquad{}MergeSort(A, low, mid) }

\texttt{\qquad{}\qquad{}MergeSort(A, mid+1, high) }

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write in \textbf{pseudocode}, an algorithm for the merge procedure,
\texttt{Merge(A, low, mid, high)} that is called by the \texttt{MergeSort}
algorithm. The merge procedure should merge the sorted subarrays in
\texttt{A{[}low..mid{]}} and \texttt{A{[}mid+1..high{]}} into a single
sorted subarray in \texttt{A{[}low..high{]}}. \hfill{}{[}6{]}
\item Give and justify the time complexity of Merge Sort. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
