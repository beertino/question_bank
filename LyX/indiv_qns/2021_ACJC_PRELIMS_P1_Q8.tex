In a hypothetical scenario, a data security company is helping a client
company manage a database of the client company\textquoteright s customers.
The data security company notices a possible vulnerability in the
database.

Further investigation shows that the vulnerability is obscure and
that none or few of the programmers anticipated it. Since the vulnerability
is obscure, they determine that the chances of the database being
breached are minimal, and decide not to tell the client company about
it. 

Instead, the data security company waits until the next time the database
is due for scheduled maintenance to attempt to fix the vulnerability.
By doing so, they can give themselves enough time to learn how to
fix the vulnerability and avoid causing unnecessary panic within the
client company or among the customers, which could lead to a potential
loss of business.

Describe how each of the following ethical guidelines was breached
by the data security company.
