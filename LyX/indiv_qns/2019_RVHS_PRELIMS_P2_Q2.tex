Driverless car
\begin{enumerate}
\item State one ethical and one social issue of using driverless car. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item A simplified decision making on the behavior of a driverless car is
as follow. 
\begin{itemize}
\item When a pedestrian is sensed 10m ahead, the driverless car \textbf{must}
apply emergency break if its current speed is more than 20 km/hr.
Otherwise, it should slow down gently.
\item In other situations, when red light is sensed 20m ahead, the driverless
car should slow down gently regardless of its speed. 
\end{itemize}
Draw a reduced decision table for the scenario above. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
