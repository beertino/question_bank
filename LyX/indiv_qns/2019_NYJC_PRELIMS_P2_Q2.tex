A stack is to be implemented using an array of 20 elements. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe an algorithm to remove an item from a stack and place it
in a variable \texttt{x}. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item With the aid of examples, explain what nested functions or nested
subroutines are. \hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item Explain with the aid of diagrams or otherwise, how a stack can be
used by the operating system to process \textquotedblleft nested functions\textquotedblright{}
or \textquotedblleft nested subroutines\textquotedblright . \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item Outline the data attributes and member functions for a class stack
abstract data type. You need not go into details as to how they will
be implemented. \hfill{}{[}6{]}
