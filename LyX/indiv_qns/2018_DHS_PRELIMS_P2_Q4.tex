A program needs to be written to store and manage product information.
The program will have the following functionality:
\begin{itemize}
\item able to display a list of products in alphabetical order 
\item able to support efficient additions and deletions 
\item able to search for a product efficiently
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why it is better to use a binary search tree (BST) than an
ordered array to store and manage product information\hfill{}. {[}2{]}

The initial list of products to be stored are: 
\noindent \begin{center}
battery, cable, detergent, medicine, soap, towel, yoyo
\par\end{center}
\item Draw the BST 
\begin{enumerate}
\item from the initial list to support efficient seach, addition and deletion 
\item when new items earphone and eraser have been inserted in that order
\item when medicine has been deleted \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item State the postorder traversal output of the updated BST. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item Outline how the BST can be reorganised after a series of additions
and deletions to ensure optimal search performance.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
