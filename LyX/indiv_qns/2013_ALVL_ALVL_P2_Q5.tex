Bank customers are allowed to withdraw money from their accounts at
an ATM. They cannot withdraw more than the current balance in their
account. There is a daily limit on the amount that can be withdrawn.
In some circumstances a charge is made for the transaction. The rules
are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the transaction is rejected if the withdrawal amount requested is
greater than the current balance 
\item the transaction is rejected if the withdrawal amount exceeds the daily
limit 
\item if the current balance before the transaction is carried out is less
than 50 dollars then any successful transaction incurs a fixed charge
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a decision table showing all the possible conditions and actions.
\hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Simplify your decision table by removing redundancies. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Using your answer in (b) write a function using pseudocode. The function
returns:
\begin{itemize}
\item -1 to indicate a rejection; 
\item 0 for a charge-free successful transaction; 
\item the charge for a chargeable successful transaction.\hfill{} {[}5{]}
\end{itemize}
\item State two ways in which your answer in (c) demonstrates clarity of
code. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
