Car owners who wish to purchase or renew their insurance policy with
XYZ Motor Insurance are required to accumulate not more than 6 demerit
points in their driving records. Under this demerit points system,
a driver who clocks up more than 20 demerit points will have his/her
driving license revoked, thus denying the person from driving and
from purchasing any vehicle insurance. Drivers who have not made any
insurance claims for the past 3 years can get 2 demerit points off,
and current employees of XYZ Motor Insurance can get 1 demerit point
deducted. In addition, drivers awarded with certificate of merit can
get 1 demerit point off as well. XYZ Motor Insurance only allows drivers
to receive a maximum deduction of 3 demerit points per year. Draw
a decision table to reflect the eligibility of car owners who wish
to purchase or renew a car insurance policy with XYZ Motor Insurance.
