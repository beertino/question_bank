Four stories are given in four data files: \texttt{AIRCON.txt}, \texttt{BLIND.txt},
\texttt{COMP.txt}, \texttt{EMPEROR.txt}. The task is to find the frequency
of alphabets used in the stories. 

\subsection*{Task 1.1 }

Count the alphabets in each story and display the frequency of each
alphabet in a table form. Do not distinguish between upper and lower
cases. Do not count non-alphabets. Frequency should be displayed in
descending order. Display alphabets with same frequency in ascending
order. 

Sample output: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\texttt{Alphabet} & \texttt{Frequency} & \tabularnewline
\texttt{e} & \texttt{20} & \tabularnewline
\texttt{t} & \texttt{14} & \tabularnewline
\cline{3-3} 
\texttt{a} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{\texttt{12}} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{\texttt{a} and \texttt{i} have same frequency of 12,}\tabularnewline
\texttt{i} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{\texttt{12}} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{display \texttt{a} before \texttt{i}, since \texttt{a} comes before
\texttt{i}}\tabularnewline
\cline{3-3} 
\texttt{o} & \texttt{10} & \tabularnewline
\texttt{u} & \texttt{6} & \tabularnewline
\cline{3-3} 
\texttt{g} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{\texttt{3}} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{\texttt{g} and \texttt{j} have same frequency of 12,}\tabularnewline
\texttt{j} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{\texttt{3}} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{display \texttt{g} before \texttt{j,} since \texttt{g} comes before
\texttt{j}}\tabularnewline
\cline{3-3} 
\texttt{z} & \texttt{1} & \tabularnewline
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

\subsection*{Task 1.2 }

Amend your program code to display alphabets and frequencies in all
four files in a table form, with alphabets in first column and frequencies
of alphabets in subsequent columns. Display in alphabetical order
as shown in following sample output: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline 
\texttt{Alphabet} & \texttt{AIRCON.txt} & \texttt{BLIND.txt} & \texttt{COMP.txt} & \texttt{EMPEROR.txt}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{a} & \texttt{115} & \texttt{471} & \texttt{604} & \texttt{490}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{b} & \texttt{25} & \texttt{87} & \texttt{111} & \texttt{56}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{c} & \texttt{46} & \texttt{117} & \texttt{230} & \texttt{107}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{$\vdots$} & \texttt{$\vdots$} & \texttt{$\vdots$} & \texttt{$\vdots$} & \texttt{$\vdots$}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{$\vdots$} & \texttt{$\vdots$} & \texttt{$\vdots$} & \texttt{$\vdots$} & \texttt{$\vdots$}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{x} & \texttt{3} & \texttt{6} & \texttt{9} & \texttt{0}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{y} & \texttt{38} & \texttt{121} & \texttt{128} & \texttt{130}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{z} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{3} & \texttt{4} & \texttt{4}\tabularnewline
