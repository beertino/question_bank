A cosmic ray striking computer memory at just the right time can flip
a bit, turning a 0 into a 1 or vice versa. 

Bit flips had caused plane accidents, software glitches, and at times,
the Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) on personal computers. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The hexadecimal number \texttt{D4} had been changed to \texttt{9A}.
Suggest the minimum number of times a bit flip could have affected
it and explain why. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Explain why Unicode characters, as compared to ASCII characters, are
more likely to be altered after a cosmic ray strike.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Define what a backup and archive is, and explain which should be prioritised
if a company is warned of a global cosmic ray strike occurring in
a week. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Explain how TCP/IP layers help to fulfil the purpose of the TCP/IP
model. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Suggest and explain a consequence on network communication when a
data packet is affected by a bit flip occurring at the Internet Layer\hfill{}
{[}2{]}
\item Explain why the consequence of a bit flip occurring at the Internet
Layer and the Transport Layer would be the same as the consequence
as a bit flip occurring at the Internet Layer only. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
