A Retail Company has a customer loyalty program that gives a range
of discounts. For customers in the loyalty program between 5 to 9
years, they will receive a 5\% discount. For 10 or more years, the
customer will receive a 10\% discount. However, whether a customer
is in the loyalty program or not, if the cumulative value of his purchases
for this calendar year exceed \$1000, he will receive a 15\% discount.
Note: Aggregation of discounts is not allowed.
