\begin{enumerate}
\item Names of employees are stored in a file. Show how a binary tree can
be used to store the employee names: \textbf{Johnson}, \textbf{Henry},
\textbf{Larry}, \textbf{Stewart}, \textbf{Alice}, \textbf{Kennedy}
in alphabetic order.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Explain why problems may arise if \textbf{Larry} is deleted from the
tree and how such problems may be overcome. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Describe an algorithm for reading the complete set of names, stored
in the tree, in alphabetical order.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item As a result of many additions and deletions, the tree has become very
unbalanced. For most nodes in the tree, the left and right subtrees
are of significantly different sizes. Describe how a new balanced
tree may be created. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
