The files \texttt{WORDS1.TXT} and \texttt{WORDS2.TXT} store a list
of single word computing terms used in a textbook.

Each entry has the following format: 

\texttt{<computing term>}

\texttt{<number>}

One of the file entries (in both files) is:

\texttt{program }

\texttt{52}

This means that after a complete scan of the textbook the word 'program'
was found 52 times.

\subsubsection*{Task 1.1}

Write program code to find and output the term with the highest number
of occurrences. Use the file \texttt{WORDS1.TXT} to test your program.

\subsubsection*{Task 1.2}

Amend your program code so that if more than one term exists with
the highest number of occurrences, all terms are reported. Use the
file \texttt{WORDS2.TXT} to test your program.
