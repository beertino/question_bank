Below is the manner in which the school library will process its overdue
list:
\begin{itemize}
\item If a book is overdue then a reminder letter would normally be sent.
\item However, if the book is more than 5 days overdue, 2 further checks
are made to see whether the reminder should be replaced by a warning
letter:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the student has had a previous warning letter the student will
not only receive the warning letter but, in addition, a copy will
be sent to the parents of the student.
\item If the student has more than 4 books overdue, but no previous warning
letter, the reminder letter is replaced by a warning letter.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a decision table showing all the possible outcomes and results.
