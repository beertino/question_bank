\item \textbf{{[}DHS/PRELIM/9597/2019/P2/Q3{]} }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a binary search tree of positive integers, devise an algorithm
\texttt{FindFloorCeiling} to find the floor and ceiling of a given
positive integer k. The floor Is the highest element in the tree less
than or equal to an integer, while the ceiling is the lowest element
in the tree greater than or equal to an integer. If either value does
not exist, return -1. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item Given a sorted array, devise an algorithm \texttt{MakeBalancedBST}
to convert it into a height-balanced binary search tree. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
