The following is the algorithm for a recursive insertion sort on an
array of size $n$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]  Base Case: If array size is 1 or smaller, return. 
\item[2.]  Recursively sort first n -- 1 elements. 
\item[3.]  Insert last element at its correct position in sorted array. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Task 2.1 }

Write program code for this algorithm to implement a recursive insertion
sort function. Use the sample array data available from text file
\texttt{COUNTRIES.txt} and paste this into your programming code.
Your program should display the sorted items with each item shown
per line. 

\subsection*{Evidence 5: }

Your program code. \hfill{}{[}8{]}

\subsection*{Task 2.2 }

Amend your code to display the insertion process done during each
recursive call. Each recursive call should display a line as follows: 

\texttt{Element at position n is being inserted in position j }

Replace \texttt{n} and \texttt{j} to show the actual index value.
