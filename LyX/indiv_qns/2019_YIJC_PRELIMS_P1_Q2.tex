The Oxford English Dictionary, published in 1989, contains 171,476
words. Instead of doing a linear search whenever we want to find a
word, it is more efficient to perform a binary search. 

\subsection*{Evidence 2.1: }

Describe the binary search algorithm. \hfill{}{[}2{]}

\subsection*{Task 2.1: }

Write a program \texttt{BinarySearch(lst, item)} to search for an
item in the list \texttt{lst} using the binary search algorithm. 

The program will:
\begin{itemize}
\item import the sorted list of words, given in the file \texttt{1000WORDS.TXT},
into a simple array \texttt{dataset}. 
\item report whether or not the item is found in the list. If found, output
the index position and the list of words examined by the program during
the binary search. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Evidence 2.2:}

Your program code and the screenshot for the following searches: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{BinarySearch(dataset, \textquotedbl WORD\textquotedbl ) }
\item \texttt{BinarySearch(dataset, \textquotedbl WORDA\textquotedbl ) }
\item \texttt{BinarySearch(dataset, \textquotedbl TRADE\textquotedbl )}
\hfill{}{[}8{]}
\end{itemize}
If we want to find all the words that start with \textquotedblleft TR\textquotedblright ,
we can perform a partial word search on the given dataset. The search
will return a word list as follows: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{{[}'TRACK', 'TRADE', 'TRAIN', 'TRAVEL', 'TREE', 'TRIANGLE',
'TRIP', 'TROUBLE', 'TRUCK', 'TRUE', 'TRY'{]}}
\par\end{center}

Using the program written in Task 2.1 to perform a binary search for
the word \textquotedblleft \texttt{TR}\textquotedblright ; the first
word starting with \textquotedblleft \texttt{TR}\textquotedblright{}
should be \textquotedblleft \texttt{TRADE}\textquotedblright{} found
at index \texttt{889}. We can now perform a linear search near index
\texttt{889} for all the words starting with \textquotedblleft \texttt{TR}\textquotedblright . 

\subsection*{Task 2.2: }

Modify the code \texttt{BinarySearch(lst, item)} written in Task 2.1. 

Your program will: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]  perform a partial search for the word in the list \texttt{lst} starting
with the given letter(s), item 
\item[2.]  perform a linear search near the index found in step (1) to return
a list of words starting with the given letter(s) 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Evidence 2.3: }

Your program code and the screenshot for the following searches: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{BinarySearch(dataset, \textquotedbl TR\textquotedbl )} 
\item \texttt{BinarySearch(dataset, \textquotedbl RE\textquotedbl )}\hfill{}
