\begin{enumerate}
\item Devise an algorithm to sort a list of words so that the anagrams are
grouped together.

For example, if the unsorted list is 

tar, phone, rat

after sorting we should get

tar, rat, phone

since tar and rat are anagrams, they are grouped together.\hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item Devise an algorithm to find the length of the longest palindrome in
a string s. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
