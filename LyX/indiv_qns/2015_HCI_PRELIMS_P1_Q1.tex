A program is to process the total points of football league teams
based on number of wins, draws and losses. The program can be run
every day. 

The program reads from file \texttt{TOP\_TEAM.txt} the current highest
points and team name from running the program on previous days. 

The program specification is to: 
\begin{itemize}
\item input \textbf{up to} four team names (max. 12 characters long) each
with the total number match wins, draws and losses so far.
\item calculate the total aggregate point for each team based on 3 points
for every win, 1 point for every draw and 0 points for every loss. 
\item display on screen: 
\begin{itemize}
\item the highest point with the team name for today 
\item a message saying whether or not the highest point today beat the current
team with the highest aggregate points. 
\end{itemize}
\item update the file \texttt{TOP\_TEAM.txt} if a higher aggregate point
was computed today. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Task 1.1 }

Write program code for this task. 

\subsection*{Evidence 1: }

Your program code for Task 1.1. \hfill{}{[}8{]}

\subsection*{Task 1.2 }

Draw up a set of test data which tests the functioning of your program.
Consider carefully all cases which could occur for both the data input
and the two processing requirements. 

\subsection*{Evidence 2: }

A screenshot for each test case you considered. Annotate the screenshot
explaining the purpose of each test. \hfill{}{[}7{]}
