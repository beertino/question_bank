\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why circuit switching could be used in this LAN. \hfill{}{[}2{]}

The network has a connection to the lnternet added.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(b)] Explain how packet switching is used when a web page is downloaded
from the Internet. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
A packet from the web server consists of 256 bytes. One of the bytes
is the checksum byte. In each byte one bit is the parity bit.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(c)]  If the byte 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 results in a parity error, state the
type of parity being used. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item[(d)]  The receiving computer uses the checksum byte to check whether the
packet contains an error. Explain how it does this.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
