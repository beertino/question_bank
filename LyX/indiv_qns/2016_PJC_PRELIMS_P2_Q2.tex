You are the assistant of the system developer. You have been asked
to draw up a plan to provide security within the system you are developing.
Describe measures you can take to ensure 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The reliability and integrity of your data \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Physical security\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Errors may occur during data transmission. Two methods of checking
for these errors are check sums and parity checks
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain how a check sum is used to check transmitted data for errors.
\hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Parity bits can be used to check for errors in transmission and may
also be used to check and self-correct data in blocks. Explain how
parity checks of data blocks can sometimes be used to correct transmission
errors automatically.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item Explain the differences between using packet switching and circuit
switching to transmit a message.\hfill{} {[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
