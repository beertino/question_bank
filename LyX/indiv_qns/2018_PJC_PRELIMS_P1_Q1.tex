\noindent A Foreign Government Agency is looking for a Tourist Information
Management System. The system should be able to cater for the following
two requirements: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a)]  Capture and provision of information for migration control propose
and other aspects of citizen identification 

This is to facilitate the processing of Disembarkation/ Embarkation
(D/E) cards collected from visitors at the checkpoints. It also captures
visitors\textquoteright{} arrival data e.g., the number of arrivals
by countries of residence, their modes of arrival and demographics
(e.g., age and gender). 
\item[b)]  Data Warehouse for analysis 

The Data Warehouse has to receive data and code information on Disembarkation/Embarkation
cards (D/E cards). Information gathered in this manner is to analyse
visitor arrival trends and serve as input to the computation of key
performance indicators (Tourism Receipts, TourismSector Value, etc.)
\end{enumerate}
The Agency wishes to replace this manual system with a computerised
system.

\noindent A system developer is employed to carry out the task. The
first task assigned to the system developer is to write a project
proposal.

One section of the project proposal is the Problem Statement which
lists the problems in the current system. Write the Problem Statement.\hfill{}
