Blackjack is a two-player card game whose rules are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The player and then the dealer are each given two cards. 
\item The player can then \textquotedbl hit\textquotedbl , or ask for
arbitrarily many additional cards, so long as their total does not
exceed 21. 
\item The dealer must then hit if their total is 16 or lower, otherwise
pass. 
\item Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum
not exceeding 21 is the winner.
\end{itemize}
For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between
2 and 10 counts as their face value, face cards count as 10, and aces
count as 1.

\item Given perfect knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck, devise
an efficient algorithm that maximises the player's score (i.e. wins
minus losses). \hfill{} {[}8{]}
\item Evaluate the efficiency of your algorithm for part (b). \hfill{}{[}3{]}
