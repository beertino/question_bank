A programmer is asked to write a program to store names in alphabetical
order.

The program needs to:
\begin{itemize}
\item add and remove names
\item search for the presence of a specific name
\item output all the names in alphabetical order. 
\end{itemize}
The programmer considers two options: an array and a linked list.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why an array allows for more efficient searching. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item State why this advantage becomes more significant as the number of
names becomes much larger. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item {}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Give \textbf{one} disadvantage of using an \textbf{array} to store
the names in alphabetical order. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Give \textbf{one} advantage of using a \textbf{linked list} to store
the names in alphabetical order. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
A third option is to store the names in a binary tree.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(c)] Explain how a binary tree provides some of the advantages of both
an array and a linked list when storing sorted data. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item[(d)] State why a binary tree may need to be re-created with exactly the
same data items. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
