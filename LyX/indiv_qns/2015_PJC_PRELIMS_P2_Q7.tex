A supermarket has a membership scheme and offer discounts to members
who make purchases. The rules that apply to its customers making purchases
and offered discounts are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item if a customer spends \$50 or more in a single transaction, a 3\% discount
would be given, 
\item if a customer spends \$150 or more in a single transaction, a 10\%
discount would be given,
\item for payment by cash, an additional 1\% discount would be given, on
top of the discount. 
\end{itemize}
