A food delivery app offers promotions to customers based on their
usage pattern. 

First time customers would receive a \$5 discount on their first purchase.
If a customer has spent at least \$1000 on the app in the last 3 months,
the app would upgrade the customer to Gold status and offer 10\% discount
on all orders. 

Gold status customers who have been inactive for 1 month would be
offered an additional 5\% discount on top of the existing 10\% discount.
Customers who have made their first purchase and have been inactive
for 1 month would receive a \$5 discount instead.
