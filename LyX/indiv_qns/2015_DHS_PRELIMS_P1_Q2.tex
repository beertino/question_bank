You are provided with the registration dates and email addresses of
participants who registered for an event in the text file \texttt{PARTICIPANTS.txt}.
Unfortunately, some participants registered more than once. 

\subsection*{Task 2.1 }

Write program code to remove duplicate entries and generate the final
participant list in alphabetical email order. If a participant registered
more than once, take the last registered record as the final entry.
Return also a count of duplicate entries removed. 

Sample output:

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{ali@yahoo.com,03-05-2015}

\texttt{dave@savetheworld.org,05-05-2015 }

\texttt{james007@bond.uk,07-05-2015}

\texttt{limahseng@gmail.com,01-05-2015 }

\texttt{mary\_ong@m1.com.sg,05-05-2015 }

\texttt{zorro@outlook.com,30-04-2015 }

\texttt{3 duplicate entries removed.}%
\end{minipage}

\subsection*{Task 2.2 }

Some email addresses may be entered wrongly. Using first principles,
write a Boolean function \texttt{Valid\_Email(email)} to determine
if an email address is valid. Design test cases to thoroughly test
the working of your function code.
