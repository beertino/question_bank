In a Battleship game, a player fires missiles within a region measuring
6 metres by 6 metres, represented with full-stops (\textquotedbl .\textquotedbl ),
to sink the ships. Each ship is represented by \textquotedbl\texttt{XXX}\textquotedbl .
The region is represented on the screen by a rectangular grid. Each
square metre of the region is represented by an x-coordinate and a
y-coordinate. The top left square metre of the region display has
\texttt{x = 0} and \texttt{y = 0}. 

\subsubsection*{Task 1.1}

In one of the games, three ships were positioned in the region as
given in the text file \texttt{GAME.TXT}. Write a program to read
in the data from this file, store it in a suitable data structure
and display on the screen as shown.

\texttt{X X X . X . }

\texttt{. . . . X . }

\texttt{. X X X . . }

\texttt{. . . . . . }%
\end{minipage}

\hfill{}{[}6{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.2}

During the game, the player cannot see the ships in the region.

\end{minipage}

Write program code to allow the player to fire 5 missiles targeting
at specific locations, one at a time after observing each outcome.
The player will input an x-coordinate and y-coordinate for each targeted
location.

If the missile strikes any part of a ship, the damaged square metre
will be represented with an \textquotedbl\texttt{S}\textquotedbl ,
otherwise an \textquotedbl\texttt{O}\textquotedbl{} to represent
it has missed. A sunken ship will be represented by \textquotedbl\texttt{SSS}\textquotedbl .

\texttt{. S . . . .}

\texttt{. . . . . .}

\texttt{. . . . . .}

\texttt{. . . . . .}%
\end{minipage}

The program code should also display the positions of all the ships
at the end of the game.

\texttt{O . . . . . }

\texttt{. . . . X . }

\subsubsection*{Task 1.3}

Write server and client program for this asymmetric Battleship game
where a server display the region and the player (the client) selects
the target locations for his missiles. After firing each missile,
the server returns an updated display for the region indicating a
strike or a miss. Once the player fires his last missile, the server
will display the positions of all the ships, together with the damages
and misses, and both the client and server quit the game. \hfill{}{[}12{]}
