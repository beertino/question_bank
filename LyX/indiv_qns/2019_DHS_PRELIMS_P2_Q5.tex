A role playing game (RPG) uses object-oriented programming (OOP) to
store its game characters' data. A character, either a hero or a monster,
has a name, health, magic points and inventory. Each character also
has a \texttt{take\_damage()} and a \texttt{display()} method. 

The game also has a special type of character, a dragon, which also
has additional data \texttt{airSpeed} and \texttt{breathType}.
