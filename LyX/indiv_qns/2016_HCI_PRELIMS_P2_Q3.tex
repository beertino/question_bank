Given two positive integers \texttt{M} and \texttt{N}, the function
\texttt{GCD(M, N)} is defined by 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]  If \texttt{M < N}, swap \texttt{M} and \texttt{N} 
\item[(ii)]  Divide \texttt{M} by \texttt{N} and let \texttt{R} be the remainder.
If \texttt{R = 0}, \texttt{N} is the answer 
\item[(iii)]  Set \texttt{M = N}, \texttt{N = R} and go back to step (i)
\end{enumerate}
Produce a recursive solution for \texttt{GCD(M,N)} using pseudocode.
You may assume the availability of the operator \texttt{MOD} as in
part \textbf{(b)}.\hfill{} {[}6{]}
