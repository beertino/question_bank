A stock control system requires that each stock item has a unique
ID consisting of six digits. The sixth digit is a check digit. This
check digit ensures that a value of 0 is the final result of the following
series of calculations:
\begin{itemize}
\item multiply each of the six digits by its position (position 6 is the
leftmost position)
\item sum the resulting six products
\item find the sum modulo 11.
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Deduce whether the following IDs are valid or not valid. Show your
working. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 810230 \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item 371025 \hfill{}{[}2{]}

\item The ID 483095 is a valid lD. Describe \textbf{one} typical data entry
error for this ID. Show how this error would be detected.\hfill{}
