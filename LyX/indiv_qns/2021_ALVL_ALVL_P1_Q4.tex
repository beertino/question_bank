A programmer is writing code to accept, store and process a number
of readings from sensors monitoring an experiment. Depending on conditions,
the experiment can generate between hundreds and hundreds of thousands
of readings. These readings are stored in a data structure. The programmer
has the option of using either a static or a dynamic data structure.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain the advantage of selecting a dynamic over static data structure
in terms of memory allocation. \hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item State two problems that might arise if a dynamic data structure is
used in terms of memory allocation. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
The readings are processed in the order they are stored.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(c)]  Identify a suitable data structure and explain your choice. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
