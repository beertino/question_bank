Perform binary addition of positive numbers. 

\subsection*{Task 4.1 }

Write program code for a function that takes two binary numbers and
returns the result after addition of these two binary numbers.
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{FUNCTION addBinary(bin1, bin2: STRING) RETURN result: STRING }
\par\end{center}

\subsection*{Evidence 13 }

Program code for Task 4.1 \texttt{addBinary}. \hfill{}{[}10{]}

\subsection*{Task 4.2}

Write a main procedure that 
\begin{itemize}
\item repeatedly ask user to input binary numbers until user input \textquoteleft \texttt{XXX}\textquoteright{}
to exit program; 
\item perform validation of binary numbers; 
\item add these binary numbers using the function \texttt{addBinary}; 
\item output result of these addition. 
\end{itemize}
Sample output: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline 
\texttt{Enter binary number 1 (XXX to exit) : 1}\tabularnewline
\texttt{Enter binary number 2 (XXX to exit) : 10}\tabularnewline
\texttt{Enter binary number 3 (XXX to exit) : XXX}\tabularnewline
\texttt{Result is 11 }\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

\subsection*{Evidence 15 }

Screenshot of running program with user input of the following six
binary numbers in order: \texttt{1000}, \texttt{1010}, \texttt{1100},
\texttt{0101}, \texttt{1111}, \texttt{0011}. \hfill{}{[}2{]}

These binary numbers can be found in the file \texttt{BITS.txt}.
