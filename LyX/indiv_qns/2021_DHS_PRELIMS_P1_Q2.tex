An array stores 16 powers of 2 integers in ascending order: 

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384,
32768 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the array is searched by means of a binary search, state which
elements would be accessed, and in what order,
\begin{enumerate}
\item when searching for the number 4096 (which is present), and \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item when searching for the number 3 (which is not present). \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item Draw a program flowchart of an iterative binary search algorithm.
\hfill{}{[}6{]}
\item Explain why binary search could be more efficient than linear search.
\hfill{} {[}1{]}
\item State the time complexities of hash table search and binary search
and explain which is more efficient with reference to their time complexities
in the above scenario. \hfill{} {[}4{]}
