An apartment block in a city consists of a large number of apartments.

in a file. 

The records in the file are to be sorted into alphabetical order of
the resident\textquoteright s name.

\item Residents sometimes make requests for maintenance on their apartments.
Each request is given a priority number ranging from 1, for failure
of the air conditioning, to 10, for a dripping tap. Each request is
stored in a linked list in order of priorities. Jobs with equal priority
are stored in order of the date that they have been submitted. 

Describe an algorithm to insert a new job into the list.\hfill{}
