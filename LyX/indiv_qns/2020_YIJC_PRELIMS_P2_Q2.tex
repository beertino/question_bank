The file \texttt{SONG.TXT} contains the lyrics of the song, Count
on me Singapore. The task is to read every word from the file, store
it in a suitable data structure, sort the words and perform searches
based on word and count.

\subsection*{Task 2.1}

Write program code to:
\begin{itemize}
\item read the words from the file and store them in a suitable data structure,
\item sort the words in alphabetical order using \textbf{quick sort}, 
\item write each word and their number of occurrence in a text file, WORDCOUNT.TXT,
where the next word is on a new line. {[}12{]}
\end{itemize}
A sample of the \texttt{WORDCOUNT.TXT} for the first 5 lines is as
follows:

\noindent %
\noindent\fbox{\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth - 2\fboxsep - 2\fboxrule}%
\texttt{a 5 }

\texttt{achieve 12 }

\texttt{air 1 }

\texttt{all 1 }

\texttt{and 9}%
\end{minipage}}

\subsection*{Task 2.2}

Write program code to:
\begin{itemize}
\item read the words and counts from the \texttt{WORDCOUNT.TX}T file 
\item allow the user to select the following options:

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{1. Search for a word }

\texttt{2. Search for word(s) based on count}

\texttt{3. Quit program}%
\end{minipage}
\item take in user input for the word or the count 
\item if found, display the word and its count, else 
\item display \textquotedbl\texttt{Not Found}\textquotedbl{} display appropriate
error messages for invalid user input \hfill{}{[}6{]}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Task 2.3}

Design test data for your program written in \textbf{Task 2.2}, provide
evidence of testing that includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item search for a word that is contained in the file 
\item search for a word that is not contained in the file
\item search for word(s) with a count that is contained in the file 
\item search for word(s) with a count that is not contained in the file
\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\end{itemize}
