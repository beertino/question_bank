\item \textbf{{[}IJC/PRELIM/9597/2018/P1/Q1{]} }

Customers of coffee shops in Singapore use \textquoteleft codewords\textquoteright{}
to order their drinks. \texttt{DRINKS.TXT} is a text file containing
the codewords. Brewed coffee drinks begin with the word \textquoteleft Kopi\textquoteright ,
while brewed tea drinks begin with the word \textquoteleft Teh\textquoteright .
All other drinks are classified as \textquoteleft Other drinks\textquoteright .

The task is to read the codewords from the file and display a list
according one of the following search criterion:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]  Brewed coffee 
\item[2.]  Brewed tea
\item[3.]  Other drinks
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Task 1.1 }

Design and write program code to:
\begin{itemize}
\item read the entire contents of \texttt{DRINKS.TXT} to an appropriate
data structure called \texttt{Drinklist} 
\item display a menu with the following options: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline
