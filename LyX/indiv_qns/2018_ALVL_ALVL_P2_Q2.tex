The following algorithm calculates the average mark for a group of
students.

\texttt{01 FOR Counter <- 1 TO NumberOfStudents}

\texttt{02 \qquad{}Total <- O}

\texttt{03 \qquad{}INPUT Mark}

\texttt{04 \qquad{}Total <- Total + Mark}

\texttt{05 ENDFOR}

\texttt{06 Average <- Total / NumberOfStudents}

\texttt{07 OUTPUT Average}%

\item There is an error in this algorithm causing an incorrect result. Describe
the error and explain the change required to correct this error. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item State the name of this type of error.\hfill{} {[}1{]}
\item The lowest mark in the exam is 0 and the highest is 100. Give an example
from each of the appropriate test cases which could be used to test
the algorithm. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Name and describe a suitable technique that could be used to manually
identify errors in the algorithm. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
