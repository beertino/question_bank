Many applications require the user to search for a data item from
a file or one-dimensional array.

\texttt{JARGON.TXT} is a text file containing computing terms with
one term per line. The program will read all the terms from \texttt{JARGON.TXT}
into an array.

The user will choose if the type of search is to find:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]  An exact match 
\item[2.]  A match at the beginning of the term text
\item[3.]  A match anywhere within the term text
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.1}

Design and write program code to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Read the entire contents of \texttt{JARGON.TXT} into an array 
\item Allow the user to repeatedly select the type of search, then input
a term 
\item Output the matching term(s) found 
\item Output a count of the number of matches 
\item End with the input of term \textquotedbl XXX\textquotedbl{}
\end{itemize}
A typical run of the program is shown below:

\texttt{+++++++++++++++++++++++ }

\texttt{1. Exact match }

\texttt{2. Start of term }

\texttt{3. Within term }

\texttt{++++++++++++++++++ }

\texttt{Choice ?1 }

\texttt{Term?firewall }

\texttt{firewall }

\texttt{There were 1 matching term(s)}

\texttt{+++++++++++++++++++++++ }

\texttt{1. Exact match }

\texttt{2. Start of term }

\texttt{3. Within term }

\texttt{++++++++++++++++++ }

\texttt{Choice ?2 }

\texttt{Term?data }

\texttt{data flow diagram }

\texttt{database management system }

\texttt{data file }

\texttt{database }

\texttt{There were 4 matching term(s)}

\texttt{+++++++++++++++++++++++ }

\texttt{1. Exact match }

\texttt{2. Start of term }

\texttt{3. Within term }

\texttt{++++++++++++++++++}

\texttt{Choice ?3 }

\texttt{Term?box }

\texttt{white box testing }

\texttt{black box testing }

\texttt{There were 2 matching term(s)}

\subsubsection*{Evidence 1}

The program code. \hfill{}{[}11{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.2}

Study the contents of \texttt{JARGON.TXT} and then design four test
cases to thoroughly test the working of your program code.

\subsubsection*{Evidence 2}

State the test data used in Task 1.2 and show screenshots to confirm
the successful testing of each of your four test cases. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
