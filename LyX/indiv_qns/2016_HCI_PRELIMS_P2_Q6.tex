A relational database is to be used by the Human Resource department
to recruit and register new students at the beginning of each year.
Four tables present in the database are STUDENT, SCHOOL, GRADES, REGISTRATION. 

A brief description of the tables are as follow: 
\begin{itemize}
\item STUDENT table stores the demographic information of students
\item SCHOOL table stores information of the school they are currently studying
\item GRADES table stores information of the subjects and grades of the
student in the previous year
\item REGISTRATION ties together all the relevant information of the students
from other tables and their registration details
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw an E-R diagram to show the relationship between the four tables
that provides for a fully normalized database design. \hfill{} {[}6{]}

A table description can be expressed as: 

\texttt{Tablename{[}Attribute1, Attribute2, \dots .. {]} }

The primary key is indicated by underlining one or more attributes. 
\end{enumerate}
(b) Give a table description for all the tables. Ensure there are
at least 2 attributes in addition to the primary key.\hfill{} {[}12{]}
