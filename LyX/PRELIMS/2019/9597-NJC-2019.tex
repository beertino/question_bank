The text files \texttt{WEATHER-JUNE-2018.TXT} and \texttt{WEATHER-JUNE-2019.TXT}
contain weather information in Singapore for the month of June in
both 2018 and 2019. Each line in either file contains tab delimited
data corresponding to (from the leftmost to the rightmost): 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline 
Date\tabularnewline
\hline 
Daily Rainfall Total (mm)\tabularnewline
\hline 
Highest 30-min Rainfall (mm)\tabularnewline

\hline

\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

The Date values are in the format: d(d) Mmm -- e.g., 1 Jun, 10 Jun.
All the remaining data values are stored as either integers (no decimal
place) or floating-point values (one decimal place). 

\subsection*{Task 1.1 }

Write the program code to read and store the data in both files. You
should use appropriate data structures to store this data such that
each individual value may be easily referenced. The data from each
file must be stored in different instances. 

\subsection*{Evidence 1 }

The program code for \textbf{Task 1.1}.\hfill{} {[}2{]}

In order to make a very simplistic observation on the effect of global
warming over the past year, you have been tasked to calculate the
median over the daily mean temperatures for the month of June in both
2018 and 2019. 

\subsection*{Task 1.2 }

Write the program code for a function that will sort each of the two
sets of data retrieved in \textbf{Task 1.1}. You are to implement
the Bubble Sort algorithm to perform this sorting. The Bubble Sort
algorithm should be applied to sort the records based on\textbf{ Mean
Temperature}. 

\subsection*{Evidence 2 }

The program code for \textbf{Task 1.2}.\hfill{} {[}5{]}

\subsection*{Task 1.3 }

Write the program code that utilises the Bubble Sort function implemented
in \textbf{Task 1.2} to calculate the \textbf{median} of the Mean
Temperatures from June 2018 and June 2019. Your program code should
then output the difference between the two temperatures. 

Sample output: 

\texttt{Difference in Median Temperatures (June 2019 \textendash{}
June 2018): 1.5°C}

\subsection*{Evidence 3 }

The program code for \textbf{Task 1.3}. \hfill{}{[}3{]}

In order to better study daily weather conditions, you must now also
create a simple textbased user interface that will allow the user
to search and output all temperatures (from both June 2018 and June
2019) that are above a certain mean temperature. 

The records that have a higher mean temperature than the specified
temperature should be output such that the following values are displayed: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline 
Date\tabularnewline
\hline 
Daily Rainfall Total (mm)\tabularnewline
\hline 
Mean Temperature (°C)\tabularnewline
\hline 
Mean Wind Speed (km/h)\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

The user interface should repeatedly prompt the user for a temperature
(i.e., a float). 

Sample input message:

\texttt{Please input a mean temperature threshold (°C):} 

Appropriate exception handling should be performed on user input,
with an appropriate warning given whenever incorrect input is specified. 

Once the user has input a temperature, the program should then output
all the records (from both the June 2018 and June 2019 files) that
have mean temperatures that are higher than the one specified. 

Sample output: 

\texttt{YEAR DATE ~~RAIN TEMP WIND }

\texttt{2018 7 Jun ~0 ~~~30.3 11.5 }

\texttt{2018 11 Jun 0 ~~~30.2 13.7 }

\texttt{2018 6 Jun ~0 ~~~30.2 12.6 }

\texttt{2019 10 Jun 0 ~~~30 ~~12.2 }

\texttt{2019 11 Jun 0 ~~~29.9 11.9 }

\texttt{2018 12 Jun 0 ~~~29.9 9.4 }

\texttt{2018 10 Jun 0 ~~~29.9 12.2 }

\texttt{2018 4 Jun ~0.4 ~29.7 7.9 }

\texttt{2019 28 Jun 0 ~~ 29.6 14.4}

\texttt{2018 17 Jun 0.4 ~29.6 11.9 }

Note that this output should be sorted in descending order of (mean)
temperature, and in the case of ties, in descending order of date.

\subsection*{Task 1.4 }

Write the program code for a function that performs an augmented Binary
Search. This function should use the sorted data from Task 1.1 to
search for the record that is just greater than a specified temperature
(i.e., the record with the lowest temperature that is just greater
than the specified temperature).

On another adventure, Lara happens upon a puzzle that requires the
calculation of Fibonacci Numbers. 

Once again, she enlists your help, and tasks you to assist her with
the computation of these numbers. However, since she abhors loops,
your implementation must be fully recursive (and thus, not include
the use of any loops -- i.e., no \texttt{while} or \texttt{for} statements). 

Note that the Fibonacci Number sequence, $F_{0}$, $F_{1}$, $F_{2}$,
\dots , is defined as follows: 
\begin{align*}
F_{0} & =0\\
F_{1} & =1\\
 & \vdots\\
F_{i} & =F_{i-1}+F_{i-2}
\end{align*}

More specifically, you are required to write a function that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Takes one positive integer value as input, $n$
\item If $n$ is a Fibonacci Number, then determine (recursively), the smallest
integer k, where $n=F_{k}$, the $k$-th Fibonacci Number, and return
the value $k$ 
\item Or else, if $n$ is not a Fibonacci Number, return the value -1 
\end{itemize}

Desmond wishes to implement a Hybrid Data Structure (HDS) using object-oriented
programming (OOP). This HDS is meant to store telephone numbers in
the following format (as a string). 
\noindent \begin{center}
<Country Code String><Space Character><Number in Country String> 
\par\end{center}

The Country Code String may include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Any digit -- i.e., 0 to 9 
\item A dash -- i.e., \textquotedblleft -\textquotedblright{} 
\end{itemize}
The Number in Country String may only include digits. It also includes
any city codes, etc. 

Consequently, you are to implement the following \texttt{PhoneNum}
class.
\noindent \begin{center}

Write the program code to implement the \texttt{PhoneNum} class. 

\subsection*{Evidence 11 }

The program code for \textbf{Task 3.1}. \hfill{} {[}3{]}

The HDS specifically corresponds to a Linked List (LL), where each
node in this LL is also the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST). 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Github/question_bank/LyX/static/img/9597-NJC-2017-P1-Q3-1}
\par\end{center}

Essentially, each LLNode stores a telephone number from a unique country,
as defined by the <Country Code String> part of the string within
each \texttt{PhoneNum} instance. Thus, among all the \texttt{PhoneNum}
instances stored in LLNodes, there cannot be any instances that share
the same Country Code String. 

The BSTNodes are sorted based on the Hash Value of each \texttt{PhoneNum}
instance. 

It should also be noted that all \texttt{PhoneNum} instances are to
be stored within an array in the HDS, and as such, all links stored
in nodes are integers corresponding to indices within this array. 

Consequently, you are to implement the following classes for the HDS. 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline

Since each LLNode is also the root node of its corresponding BST,
the \texttt{Node} class defined above is used to represent both LLNodes
and BSTNodes. 

The \texttt{link2} and \texttt{link3} attributes always correspond
to the left and right nodes of the BST, whereas \texttt{link1} corresponds
to either: (a) the next link in the LL when the node in question is
a LLNode; or (b) the previous link in the BST when the node in question
is a BSTNode. BSTNode BSTNode BSTNode BSTNode BSTNode BSTNode LLNode

The following are the descriptions of the various attributes and methods
within the abovementioned Node and HDS classes. 

\begin{tabular*}{0.1\paperwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}|l|l|}
\hline 
\textbf{Attribute/Method} & \textbf{Description}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Node.constructor()} & Initialisation of a \texttt{Node} instance assigns the value\texttt{
-1} to \texttt{link1}, \texttt{link2}, and \texttt{link3} attributes,
and a \texttt{NULL} value to the \texttt{data} attribute.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Node.data} & This attribute is used to store an instance of \texttt{PhoneNum}.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Node.link1 } & \multirow{3}{*}{Each of these attributes references an index (i.e., integer) from
\texttt{HDS.nodes}. To indicate an empty reference, the value\texttt{
-1} is used. When the \texttt{Node} instance in question corresponds
to a LLNode, \texttt{link1} corresponds to the index of the next LLNode.
When the Node instance in question corresponds to a BSTNode, \texttt{link1}
corresponds to the index of the previous BSTNode (of LLNode). The
\texttt{link2} and \texttt{link3} attributes always correspond to
the indices of the left and right nodes in the BST.}\tabularnewline
\texttt{Node.link2} & \tabularnewline
\texttt{Node.link3} & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Node.print()} & This method should output the integer values stored in \texttt{link1},
\texttt{link2}, and \texttt{link3}, as well as the value in data the
following format: \texttt{DATA: <STRING>; HASH: <INTEGER>; LINK1: <INTEGER>;
LINK2: <INTEGER>; LINK3: <INTEGER>}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{HDS.nodes } & \multirow{3}{*}{The attribute \texttt{HDS.nodes} corresponds to an array of 25 \texttt{Node}
instances. This array is to be pre-initialised with 25 unused \texttt{Node}
instances. This value should be specified on creation of the new instance
(i.e., as an argument). The \texttt{HDS.free} attribute references
the index of the head (i.e., first node) of a singly-linked linked
list of empty \texttt{Node} instances. The \texttt{Node.link1} values
are used to reference each subsequent node index in this linked list.
When initialising the \texttt{HDS.nodes} attribute, you must ensure
that this linked list of free nodes is initialised as well. The \texttt{HDS.first}
attribute references index of the head (i.e., first node) of the actual
HDS.}\tabularnewline
\texttt{HDS.free } & \tabularnewline
\texttt{HDS.first} & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{HDS.insert(PhoneNum)} & The \texttt{HDS.insert} method takes a \texttt{PhoneNum} instance
as input and inserts it into the HDS. Note that each \texttt{Node}
instance inserted into the actual HDS must correspond to a \texttt{Node}
instance from the LL of free nodes, which is referenced by the head
of the free node LL at the index stored in the attribute \texttt{HDS.free}.
Insertion requires you to first remove the node from the LL of free
nodes before inserting it into the actual HDS. When inserting into
the HDS, you must first check the Country Code String part of \texttt{PhoneNum}
and insert it into the LL part of the HDS only if that country code
does not already exist in the LL part of HDS. If the Country Code
String part of the \texttt{PhoneNum} instance in question does exist
(in the LL part of the HDS), then it is instead to be inserted into
the BST whose root shares the same Country Code String. When inserting
into a BST within the HDS, do recall that within each BST, nodes are
sorted based on Hash Value.\tabularnewline

\texttt{HDS.contains(PhoneNum)} & This method will return True if the given \texttt{PhoneNum} instance
exists within the \texttt{HDS}, or else returns False.\tabularnewline

to print each \texttt{Node} instance within \texttt{HDS.nodes}, \texttt{Node.print()}
should be called.\tabularnewline

At Central Secondary School, the current system for tracking Co-Curricular
Activity (CCA) equipment requires manual updating. More specifically,
the teachers in-charge of CCAs manage printed records of their equipment
inventories. 

In this system, stock-taking of equipment is performed once per year,
where teachers and students perform a physical count of each item
on an inventory list. At this point, any damaged or lost items are
flagged, and then replacements are ordered. To process orders, requests
are submitted to the general office. 

A new automated system that utilises Radio-frequency identification
(RFID) tags has been proposed. The proposal is to use passive RFID
tags, which, unlike a barcode, do not need to be within the line of
sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. 

Within the proposed system, each piece of CCA equipment will be embedded
with an RFID tag, which would allow them to be easily tracked. Tracking
is performed by several RFID readers that will be positioned at various
venues where CCA equipment are typically stored. Teacher and staff
may access this data by physically linking a computer to each RFID
reader. 

The main idea behind the proposed system is to have an inventory system
that may be continuously updated, which would remove the need for
the annual stock-taking exercise, and ensure that inventory is replenished
in a timelier fashion.

The proposed network design for the RFID CCA Inventory system is as
follows: 

Each CCA Store room will have a set of RFID-Reader linked to a desktop
computer. The computers in every CCA Store need to be able to access
a centralised database server to update the inventory records. The
database server is physically located in another room in the same
building as all the CCA store rooms.

\item[(p)]  Describe the transmission mode used between RF Reader and the RF
TAGS in terms of how data is transferred between them. Justify your

\end{enumerate}
After the proposed system has been implemented successfully, the school
is considering a Phase 2 implementation to include embedding RFID
tags to the school badges worn by the students and placing RFID readers
in different locations within the school compound. This will allow
attendance to be taken automatically and to track the movement of
students in the school. 

Given the fact that passive RFID tags do not have any access control
system, any commercially available RFID reader sold in the market,
is capable of accessing the information stored in the RFID tags.

\item Write the Pseudocode for a function that will iteratively (i.e., not
recursively) print the Pascal\textquoteright s Triangle of depth $n$,
where $n$ is the only parameter of this function. You may not use
the binomial coefficient formula or use factorial calculations within
this implementation. 

Note that in your implementation, you need not worry about the centring
the triangle. For example, when $n=5$, you may instead output:

A proprietary network system is to be designed and built for streaming
high definition digital live video feeds from a number of CCTV cameras
in a multi-storey building within a prison facility. The video feeds
are to be accessed on computers within the building as well as in
a remote location linked by a private communication link.

decision has to be made as to whether to use a synchronous or asynchronous
protocol. Explain the differences between the synchronous and asynchronous
mode in data communications. \hfill{} {[}2{]}

A few additional assumptions regarding the data are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Each student will have a unique Student ID 
\item Student Name, Contact Number, and Address, may not be unique 
\item Parent Name and Contact may not be unique; a parent may have more
than one child at the school 
\item A student may only belong to a single Homeroom Class in each academic
year; the Homeroom Class identifier may be reused in each new academic
year 
\item Student Subject Classes are assigned at the beginning of an academic
year, but may be changed during the course of the year, each subject
class is a 2-tuple with the following properties: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Subject Code -- these are unique for each academic level, but may
exist more than once across different academic levels 
\item Subject Class Code -- these are unique within the school for an academic
year, but may not be unique across different academic years 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
It should also be noted that the school also stores two other sets
of records, which are as follows.
