A web log,\texttt{ WEBLOG.txt}, keeps track of the date and time the
server is being accessed, and the client that accessed it. The client
is identified by either the host name or internet address. The format
of \texttt{WEBLOG.txt} is as follows: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{<host name>|<DD/MMM/YYYY:HH:MM:SS> }
\par\end{center}

or
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{<internet address>|<DD/MMM/YYYY:HH:MM:SS> }
\par\end{center}

Below is a sample of \texttt{WEBLOG.txt}: 

\noindent\fbox{\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth - 2\fboxsep - 2\fboxrule}%
\texttt{199.72.81.55|01/Jul/1995:00:00:01 }

\texttt{unicomp6.unicomp.net|01/Jul/1995:00:00:06 }

\texttt{199.120.110.21|01/Jul/1995:00:00:09 }

\texttt{burger.letters.com|01/Jul/1995:00:00:11} %
\end{minipage}}

The client address (host name or internet address) can appear multiple
times, depending on how many times it accessed the server. Similarly,
the date it accessed the server can be duplicated too because it can
access the server many times in a day. 

A summary report, SUMMARY.txt, is to be generated to list the \textbf{unique}
clients (hosts name/internet address) and the corresponding list of
\textbf{unique} dates that it has accessed the server, from the web
log, \texttt{WEBLOG.txt}. 

Below is a sample of \texttt{SUMMARY.txt}: 

\noindent\fbox{\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth - 2\fboxsep - 2\fboxrule}%
\texttt{199.72.81.55 01/Jul/1995,03/Jul/1995,04/Jul/1995 }

The files \texttt{CUPS-SOLD1.txt} and \texttt{CUPS-SOLD2.txt} contain
the daily total number of cups of coffee sold at a café over a period
of 50 days. The task is to read the daily sales from the file and
to allow a search for a specific sales figure. You will program two
different search algorithms: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear Search 
\item Binary Search 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Task 2.1 }

Write program code that repeatedly: 
\begin{itemize}
\item displays a menu with the following options:
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}

1. Read File\tabularnewline
2. Linear Search\tabularnewline
3. Binary Search\tabularnewline
4. End\tabularnewline

\item calls an appropriate procedure/function depending on the user\textquoteright s
option.
\end{itemize}

Options 2 and 3 will perform a search for a specified sales figure
and display a message to indicate if it is found or not. 

\subsection*{Task 2.3}

Write program code as a function to implement the linear search for
menu option 2. The function will return 0 if the sales figure is found,
or -1 if it is not found. 

The program will: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Input a sales figure 
\item Use the function \texttt{LinearSearch} 
\item Report whether or not this sales figure was found.
\end{itemize}
Use \texttt{CUPS-SOLD1.txt} to test your program code. 

Run the program two times. Use the following inputs: \texttt{167}
and \texttt{405}. 

\subsection*{Evidence 8}

is found, or \texttt{-1} if it is not found. 

\textbf{{*}Hint: Do not use any pre-defined sort function e.g. sort()
in your program code.}

The program will: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Input a sales figure
\item Use the function \texttt{BinarySearch} 
\item Report whether or not this sales figure was found.

An application is to be created to store a Football League table data.
The team names are stored in the file \texttt{TEAMS.txt}. The results
of the football matches are provided in file \texttt{RESULTS.txt}.

Each match data takes up one line, for example: \texttt{MadUnited
2 Chelsand 1 }

That is, \texttt{MadUnited} won \texttt{Chelsand}, scoring two goals
and conceding one goal, or Chelsand lost to Mad United, scoring one
goal and conceding two goals. 

The League table that needs to be created has the following information: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llllllllll}
\textbf{Team} &  & \textbf{P} & \textbf{W} & \textbf{D} & \textbf{L} & \textbf{GF} & \textbf{GA} & \textbf{GD} & \textbf{Points}\tabularnewline

goals for (GF), goals against (GA)
\item for e.g. the data \textquotedblleft \texttt{MadUnited 2 Chelsand 1}\textquotedblright{}

The task is to store a dataset of students\textquoteright{} names
and test scores (max size of 20 students) as a binary tree structure.
The text file \texttt{SCORES.txt} stores the students\textquoteright{}
names and test scores in the following format: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{<Student Name>|<Score> }
\par\end{center}

All test scores are integer values in the range 0 to 100 inclusive. 

The program will use a user-defined type \texttt{Node} for each node
defined as follows: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Identifier} & \textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{Description}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{LeftP} & \texttt{INTEGER} & The left pointer for the node\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Name} & \texttt{STRING} & The name of the student\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Score} & \texttt{INTEGER} & The score of the student\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{RightP} & \texttt{INTEGER} & The right pointer for the node\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

A linked list is maintained of all the unused nodes which do not form
part of the tree. The first available node which is used for a new
student is indicated by \texttt{NextFreePosition}. Nodes in the unused
list are linked using their left pointers.

The binary tree and linked list are implemented using variables as
follows:
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Identifier} & \textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{Description}\tabularnewline
\hline 
ThisTree & ARRAY{[}20{]}: Node & The tree data\tabularnewline
\hline 
Root & INTEGER & Index for the root position of the array\tabularnewline
\hline 
NextFreePosition & INTEGER & Index for the next unused node\tabularnewline
