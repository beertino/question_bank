A food delivery app offers promotions to customers based on their
usage pattern. 

First time customers would receive a \$5 discount on their first purchase.
If a customer has spent at least \$1000 on the app in the last 3 months,
the app would upgrade the customer to Gold status and offer 10\% discount
on all orders. 

Gold status customers who have been inactive for 1 month would be
offered an additional 5\% discount on top of the existing 10\% discount.
Customers who have made their first purchase and have been inactive
for 1 month would receive a \$5 discount instead.

A printing shop offers printing services to its customers. When a
printing order is sent to the shop, the following information is recorded
down:
\begin{itemize}
\item Date of order 
\item Name of customer 
\item Number of copies 
\item Colour, or black and white, printing 
\item Whether express printing is required
\end{itemize}
The printing shop accepts three types of orders, leaflets, books and
posters.

Customers printing leaflets or books need to indicate if they require
single side or double side printing.

In addition, for books, the type of cover (hard cover or soft cover)
would need to be recorded. 

Leaflets and books are available in three sizes (A3, A4 or A5), while
posters are only available in a fixed size of A2.

For poster printing, customers have a choice of either glossy or matte
finishing.

The total charge to user is determined by the specifications of the
order and the formula is unique for each type of order.

This system is to be implemented using object-oriented programming
(OOP).

For the \texttt{attack} method, \texttt{opponent} is another person.
\begin{itemize}
\item A random integer \texttt{r} between \texttt{1} and \texttt{10} (inclusive)

\item If the player\textquoteright s \texttt{strength} is less than \texttt{r},
then the player does not have enough strength to attack and there

\item If the player\textquoteright s \texttt{strength} is at least \texttt{r},
then the attack is successful and \texttt{opponent}\textquoteright s
\texttt{health} is decreased by \texttt{r}. 
\begin{itemize}

An $\mathtt{n\times n}$ chessboard consists of an $\mathtt{n\times n}$
grid of small squares. For this task, the squares are numbered using
a coordinate system as a tuple of two integers. The first integer
is the column number, starting from \texttt{1} at the left, and the
second integer is the row number, starting from \texttt{1} at the
bottom.

A chess knight is a piece that occupies a square, and can then move
to another square according to one of the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item moving two squares horizontally and then one square vertically in
either direction, or 
\item moving two squares vertically and then one square horizontally in

The knight at \texttt{(2,1)} can move to \texttt{(1,3)}, \texttt{(3,3)}

The knight at \texttt{(6,7)} can move to \texttt{(4,6)}, \texttt{(4,8)},
\texttt{(5,5)}, \texttt{(7,5)}, \texttt{(8,6)} or \texttt{(8,8)}.

Only the starting and ending squares of the knight\textquoteright s
move are counted as being visited by the knight, and not the squares
that the knight passes over while moving.

A knight\textquoteright s tour is a sequence of moves that a chess
knight makes on a chessboard, so that it visits every square of the
chessboard exactly once. It does not need to return to its starting
square.

\subsubsection*{Task 2.1}

For a given value of \texttt{n} and a list of squares, write program
code to determine if the list is a knight\textquoteright s tour of
an $\mathtt{n\times n}$ chessboard.

Test your code using the values\texttt{ $\mathtt{n=7}$} and the list

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{TASK2TOUR.txt}, which is a valid tour; 
\item \texttt{TASK2NOTOUR.txt}, which is not a valid tour. \hfill{}{[}10{]}

An algorithm to generate a knight\textquoteright s tour needs to keep
track of the squares already visited, so that the knight does not
visit them a second time during the tour.

\subsubsection*{Task 2.2}

Suppose the knight is currently on square square, and a list of squares
already visited by the knight is given in \texttt{lis}.

Write a function \texttt{available(square,lis)} that returns a list
of squares which the knight can visit on its next move from \texttt{square},
and are not currently in \texttt{lis}. These are the squares available
to the knight as it tries to complete the tour.

The output should be given in lexicographic order, that is, with the
column numbers in ascending order, and, among the squares with the
same column number, with the row numbers in ascending order. \hfill{}{[}6{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 2.3}

The knight starts at \texttt{(1,1)}, the bottom left square, of an
$8\mathtt{\times}8$ chessboard.

From each square, the knight moves to the available square from which
it has the smallest number of available squares after that. If there
is a tie, the square which comes first in lexicographic order is chosen.

Write program code to generate the knight\textquoteright s tour as
a list of squares in the order they are visited.

On 14 September 2020, it was reported that GrabCar was fined S\$10,000
for a 4th user data privacy violation. The Personal Data Protection
Commission (PDPC) said the update risked the personal data of 21,541
drivers and passengers, including profile pictures, names and vehicle
plate numbers. 

GrabCar rolled back the app to the previous version within about 40
minutes and took other remedial action, PDPC said. 

On Aug 30, 2019, GrabCar notified the PDPC that profile data of 5,651
GrabHitch drivers was exposed to the risk of unauthorised access by
other GrabHitch drivers for a \textquotedbl short period of time
on the same day\textquotedbl{} through the Grab app. 

Grab's investigations traced the cause of the breach to a deployment
of an update to the app on the same day. The purpose of the update
was to address a potential vulnerability discovered within the Grab
app. 

In PDPC's findings, the application programming interface URL which
allowed GrabHitch drivers to access their data, had contained a \textquotedbl userID\textquotedbl{}
portion that could potentially be manipulated to allow access to other
drivers' data. According to GrabCar, there was no evidence that this
vulnerability was exploited. 

To fix the vulnerability, the update removed the \textquotedbl userID\textquotedbl{}
from the URL, which shortened it to a hard-coded \textquotedbl users/profile\textquotedbl .
However, it failed to take into account the URL-based caching mechanism
in the app, which was configured to refresh every 10 seconds. 

The mechanism served cached content in response to data requests,
so as to reduce the load of direct access to GrabCar's database. 

With the update, all URLs in the Grab app ended with \textquotedbl users/profile\textquotedbl .
Without the \textquotedbl userID\textquotedbl{} in the URL, which
directed data requests to the correct GrabHitch driver's accounts,
the caching mechanism could no longer differentiate between drivers. 

Thus, the mechanism provided the same data to all GrabHitch drivers
for 10 seconds before new data was retrieved from GrabCar's database
and cached for the next 10 seconds. 

PDPC said GrabCar did not put in place \textquotedbl sufficiently
robust processes\textquotedbl{} to manage changes to its IT system
that may put personal data it was processing at risk. 

\textquotedbl This was a particularly grave error given that this
is the second time the (GrabCar) is making a similar mistake, albeit
with respect to a different system,\textquotedbl{} he said.

In a statement in response to Reuters' query, Grab said: \textquotedbl To
prevent a recurrence, we have since introduced more robust processes,
especially pertaining to our IT environment testing, along with updated
governance procedures and an architecture review of our legacy application
and source codes.\textquotedbl{} 

In 2019, GrabCar was ordered to pay a financial penalty of S\$16,000
after it sent out more than 120,000 marketing emails to customers
containing the name and mobile phone number of another customer. 

The PDPC had found that GrabCar \textquotedblleft failed to make reasonable
security arrangements\textquotedblright{} to detect the errors in
their database when sending out the emails.

On 28 June 2020, nearly 10,000 TraceTogether tokens were distributed
to vulnerable seniors. The TraceTogether token supplements the TraceTogether
mobile app by extending contact tracing to groups in the community
who do not have smart phones and those whose phones do not work well
with the TraceTogether app. 

The TraceTogether token is designed to capture proximity data based
on Bluetooth signals. Every five minutes, it scans to detect other
TraceTogether users on the token or the app. The more 'hits' between
two TraceTogether users, the more likely they are in close proximity
for an extended period of time. Proximity can be estimated by the
strength of the Bluetooth signal. The closer users are to one another,
the stronger the signal and vice versa. 

There are only four types of data contained in the token: 
\begin{itemize}
\item user's randomised ID 
\item randomised ID of any other user in proximity 
\item Bluetooth signal measured using RSSI{*} 
\item timestamp of the encounter. 
\end{itemize}
{*}Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is a measure of the power
level at the receiver. A more negative number indicates a device is
further away. For example, a value of -20 to -30 indicates a device
is close while a value of -120 indicates it is near the limit of detection. 

It is important to note that these IDs do not refer to NRIC number,
but randomised and anonymised IDs linked to a personal identifier
like a mobile number. Also, no data is extracted unless a user has
tested positive for COVID-19. From there, MOH has a special software
key that can unlock the device and reveal the data for use in contact
tracing. 

A senior is tested positive for COVID-19 and MOH needs to perform
contact tracing. With the user's permission, data from its TraceTogether
token is retrieved and extracted to the file \texttt{TOKEN.txt} and
has the following structure: 

\texttt{UserRandomisedID, OtherRandomisedID, RSSI, Timestamp} 

Timestamp is in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. 

\subsection*{Task 1.1 }

Prolonged exposure is currently defined as being in close contact
for at least 15 minutes within a single session. For simplicity, you
may assume close contact as a Bluetooth signal strength of greater

only uses the first two letters of the name. Nothing else in the name
is used for sorting. However, if two names have the same first two
letters, they should stay in the same order as in the input (this

order (with uppercase letters sorting before lowercase letters i.e.
A<B<\dots <Z<a<b<\dots <z). 

\subsubsection*{Input }

The input file \texttt{LASTNAMES.txt} consists of a sequence of up

\item Run-length encoding is a simple data compression technique that can
be effective when repeated values occur at adjacent positions within
a string. Compression is achieved by replacing groups of repeated
values with one copy of the value, followed by the number of times
the value should be repeated. For example, \textquotedblleft \texttt{AAAAABBBAAAB}\textquotedblright{}
would be compressed as \textquotedblleft \texttt{A5B3A3B1}\textquotedblright .

start position of the first occurrence of \texttt{Q} in \texttt{P},
or zero if there is no occurrence. Assume the string index starts
at 1. For example, if \texttt{P} is '\texttt{bananas}' and Q is '\texttt{na}'
then the function would give the result 3, because '\texttt{na}' first
occurs in '\texttt{bananas}' starting at character position three.

10. Array index starts at 1. 
\item Head pointer, pointing to the first element in the linked list 
\item Tail pointer, pointing to the last element in the linked list

This superclass has the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Initialise()} method sets up an empty linked list. Should
link all nodes to form the free list. Initialise values for head pointer,
tail pointer and free pointer 
\item \texttt{Add(item)} appends the parameter into its correct \textbf{alphabetical}
order in the linked list. 
\item \texttt{Remove(item)} removes the parameter from the ordered linked
list 
\item \texttt{Display()} displays the data items in the linked list in alphabetical
order 
\item \texttt{PrintStructure()} displays the current state of all pointers
and the array contents in index order 
\item \texttt{IsEmpty()} tests for empty linked list 
\item \texttt{IsFull()} tests for no unused nodes
\end{itemize}
The superclass is used to implement a linear queue. 

The subclass \texttt{Queue} has the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Add(item)} appends the parameter to the queue and overrides
the \texttt{LinkedStructure} add method . 
\item \texttt{Remove()} returns and removes the next item in the queue
\item \texttt{Display()} method should display the queue contents in order
(e.g. the earliest added item first) and should override the \texttt{LinkedStructure}
display method.

Each method updates its appropriate pointers, and produces suitable
errors (or returns different values) to indicate if the actions are
not possible, e.g. if the structure is empty.

cannot be inserted until all the existing elements are removed from

The library in Jurong Pioneer Primary School uses a hybrid data structure
to keep track of its inventory. Each record in the hash table stores
a simple list \texttt{{[}<Category>, <Binary Search Tree object>{]}}.
Each node in the Binary Search Tree (BST) stores the ISBN number and
title of a book. The nodes in each BST share the same book category
and are sorted, in ascending order, according to their ISBN numbers. 

\subsection*{Task 3.1 }

Write the object-oriented code for the \texttt{BST} and \texttt{BSTNode}
classes described above. \hfill{}{[}10{]}

A checksum is applied to determine the Hash Value for each \texttt{<Category>},
where the ASCII value of each character in the title is multiplied
by its position in the \texttt{<Category>} string (starting from left
to right), and then summed. 

For example, given the category \textquotedblleft classics\textquotedblright ,
the summed value would thus be: $99\times1+108\times2+97\times3+115\times4+115\times5+105\times6+99\times7+115\times8=3884$.

$(3884\mod19)+1=9$

A weighted modulus 19 operation is then applied and 1 is added to
the remainder to determine the final Hash Value.

A binary tree is used to represent this coding system. Each node,
except the root node, contains a letter of the alphabet. The position
of each letter in the tree is determined by its Morse code. Moving
from one node to another down the tree is done by traversing either
a left branch or a right branch. A left branch corresponds to a .

You are to create a song playlist using a doubly linked list implemented
using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The doubly linked list data
structure is a linked list made up of nodes with two pointers pointing
to the next and previous element. 
\begin{center}

A doubly linked list allows traversal of nodes in both direction which
is not possible in a singly linked list. For example, a user can go
forward or backwards to play the next or previous song.

The \texttt{node}, will store the following data: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{title (str) }
\item \texttt{prev (node) }
\item \texttt{next (node)} 
\end{itemize}
The class, \texttt{SongPlaylist}, will store the following data: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a doubly linked list of \texttt{node} objects. 
\item \texttt{head} pointer, pointing to the first \texttt{node} in the
doubly linked list. 
\end{itemize}
The class \texttt{SongPlaylist} has the following methods: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{insert(SongPlaylist, title: str)} adds a song title at the
beginning of the list. 
\item \texttt{insertafter(SongPlaylist, searchtitle: str, newtitle: str)}
adds a song title after \texttt{searchtitle}.
\item \texttt{display(SongPlaylist)} outputs out the playlist. 
\end{itemize}
For each of the sub-tasks, add a comment statement, at the beginning

A school wants to create a database to allow students to register
for different enrichment activities that will be held on the school\textquoteright s
Enrichment Day. An enrichment activity falls under one of three categories
-- Arts, Cultural, and Sports. 

It is expected that the database should be normalised. 

When a student registers for an activity, the following information
is recorded: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{StudentID} - unique 6-digit register number of the student. 
\item \texttt{Type} - type of activity (\texttt{'A\textquoteright }, \texttt{\textquoteleft C\textquoteright{}}
or \texttt{'S'}). 
\item \texttt{Venue} - where the activity will be held. 
\item \texttt{Session} - whether the activity is conducted in the morning
or afternoon (\texttt{'AM'} means the morning session, and \texttt{'PM'}
means the afternoon session). 
\end{itemize}

In a Battleship game, a player fires missiles within a region measuring
6 metres by 6 metres, represented with full-stops (\textquotedbl .\textquotedbl ),
to sink the ships. Each ship is represented by \textquotedbl\texttt{XXX}\textquotedbl .
The region is represented on the screen by a rectangular grid. Each
square metre of the region is represented by an x-coordinate and a
y-coordinate. The top left square metre of the region display has
\texttt{x = 0} and \texttt{y = 0}. 

\subsubsection*{Task 1.1}

In one of the games, three ships were positioned in the region as
given in the text file \texttt{GAME.TXT}. Write a program to read
in the data from this file, store it in a suitable data structure
and display on the screen as shown.

The player will input an x-coordinate and y-coordinate for each targeted
location.

If the missile strikes any part of a ship, the damaged square metre
will be represented with an \textquotedbl\texttt{S}\textquotedbl ,
otherwise an \textquotedbl\texttt{O}\textquotedbl{} to represent
it has missed. A sunken ship will be represented by \textquotedbl\texttt{SSS}\textquotedbl .

The task is to store words in nodes that is contained within a linked
list data structure. A node contains a word, the word category and
a next pointer. The pointers link the word items in proper grammatical
order based on their word category (\textquoteleft N\textquoteright :
noun, \textquoteleft V\textquoteright : verb, \textquoteleft D\textquoteright :
determiner, \textquoteleft J\textquoteright : adjective). The unused
nodes are linked as shown below. The first unused node is the position
where the new word item is to be stored.

\end{itemize}
\item Methods
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\_\_init\_\_ : PROCEDURE} - Sets all the node data values
to \textquoteleft empty string\textquoteright . Set pointers to indicate
all nodes are unused and linked. Initialise values for start and nextfree.
\item \texttt{isempty : FUNCTION RETURNS BOOLEAN} - Tests for empty linked
list.
\item \texttt{isfull : FUNCTION RETURNS BOOLEAN} - Tests for no unused nodes.
\item \texttt{display : PROCEDURE} - Displays the contents of sentence in
index order. 
\item \texttt{insert : PROCEDURE} - Adds a new word and its category to
the linked list. 
\item \texttt{traversal : PROCEDURE} - Displays the simple sentence obtained
from the linked list.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The index of the first available node is indicated by \texttt{nextfree}.
The initial values of \texttt{start} and \texttt{nextfree} is -1 and
0 respectively.

A hash table has 8 spaces to store strings, indexed from 1 to 8 inclusive.

The hash function finds the ASCII number of the first letter of the
string, then counts the number of 1s in its binary representation.
This is the index in which the string will be inserted into the hash
table.

For example, the string \texttt{'Arlington'} will have index 2 because
the ASCII number of '\texttt{A}' is 65, which is \texttt{1000001}
in binary, and there are two \texttt{1}s.

The following strings are to be inserted into the hash table in the

A gym organises various classes and runs a loyalty membership programme
with four tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Diamond 

Upon joining, each member is given a unique membership number and
starts with a Bronze membership. Each member can sign up for multiple
classes at a reduced rate based on the membership tier.

Each class has a unique class name. Some classes are offered at three
different levels: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced

Each instructor is identified with a unique three-character code and
can take one or more classes.

In a hypothetical scenario, a data security company is helping a client
company manage a database of the client company\textquoteright s customers.
The data security company notices a possible vulnerability in the
database.

Further investigation shows that the vulnerability is obscure and
that none or few of the programmers anticipated it. Since the vulnerability
is obscure, they determine that the chances of the database being
breached are minimal, and decide not to tell the client company about
it. 

Instead, the data security company waits until the next time the database
is due for scheduled maintenance to attempt to fix the vulnerability.
By doing so, they can give themselves enough time to learn how to
fix the vulnerability and avoid causing unnecessary panic within the
client company or among the customers, which could lead to a potential
loss of business.

\noindent The Universal Product Code (UPC) system is used for tracking
trade items in shipping, inventory, and sales. Each item is given
a 12-digit identification number. The validity of this identification
number can be checked using a checksum. If $x_{i}$ represents the
$i$th digit (starting with $i=1$ as the leftmost digit), then a
valid identification number satisfies the condition that

\noindent 
\[
3x_{1}+x_{2}+3x_{3}+x_{4}+3x_{5}+x_{6}+3x_{7}+x_{8}+3x_{9}+x_{10}+3x_{11}+x_{12}
\]

\noindent has a remainder of 0 when divided by 10.

\noindent The identification number can be encoded into a barcode.
For this Task, the barcode will be represented as a string of '\texttt{0}'s
and '\texttt{1}'s, where '\texttt{0}' represents a white stripe and
'\texttt{1}' represents a black stripe.

\noindent The barcode is divided into seven sections. From left to
right, they are
\begin{itemize}
\item A \textquoteleft quiet zone\textquoteright{} consisting of nine '\texttt{0}'s; 
\item A start pattern which is always '\texttt{101}'; 
\item The first six digits of the identification number are encoded using
the table below; 
\item A middle pattern which is always '\texttt{01010}'; 
\item The last six digits of the identification number are encoded using
the table below; 
\item An end pattern which is always '\texttt{101}'; 
\item A \textquoteleft quiet zone\textquoteright{} consisting of nine '\texttt{0}'s.
\end{itemize}
\noindent The table below shows the encoding system for the digits.
Note that depending on whether the digit occurs in the first six digits
or the last six digits, it would be encoded differently. However,
the two encodings are optical inverses of each other -- a '\texttt{0}'
is changed into a '\texttt{1}', and vice versa.
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
Digit  & First six digits & Last six digits\tabularnewline

\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

\noindent The reason for encoding the first and last six digits differently
is that the barcode may inadvertently be scanned upside down. Notice
that in the first six digits, the encoding for each digit contains
an odd number of '\texttt{1}'s, while in the last six digits, the
encoding for each digit contains an even number of '\texttt{1}'s.
This allows the scanning software to detect if the barcode has been
placed upside down and correct it. \quad{} 

\noindent For example, the UPC identification number 036000 291452
would be encoded as:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
000000000 & 101 & 0001101 & 0111101 & 0101111 & 0001101\tabularnewline

\noindent A file compression algorithm reduces file sizes so that
files can be sent more quickly. One such algorithm is the Huffman
algorithm for text files, which will be implemented in this task.

\noindent Unlike ASCII, which assigns a fixed size of 8 bits for each
character, the Huffman algorithm assigns fewer bits to more common
characters and more bits to less common characters. For example, in
a long text written in English, characters such as '\texttt{e}' and
'\texttt{t}' will have fewer bits assigned to them than characters
such as '\texttt{q}' and '\texttt{z}'. If the text is long enough,
this will use fewer bits in total to encode the text compared to ASCII.

\noindent To know which sequence of bits to encode for each character,
the \textbf{frequency} of each character, which is the number of times
each character appears in the text file, is tabulated.

\noindent The characters are put into a tree. A node is created for
each character. The following steps are then repeated until there
is only one node without a parent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the two nodes, without parents, which have the lowest frequency. 
\item Create a new node whose left and right children are the two nodes
identified in Step 1. The frequency of the new node is the total of
the frequency of its children.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent The diagram on the following page shows the process of creation
of a tree for a file with only five distinct characters ('\texttt{A}',
'\texttt{E}', '\texttt{I}', '\texttt{O}' and '\texttt{U}'), in five
stages.

\noindent The bit sequence assigned to a character will be the path
from the root to the node corresponding to that character, where going
left corresponds to '\texttt{0}' and going right corresponds to '\texttt{1}'.
For example, '\texttt{A}' is encoded as '\texttt{10}' and '\texttt{O}'
is encoded as '\texttt{011}'.

\subsection*{Task 2.1}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{data}, which is determined when the node is initialized 
\item \texttt{left}, a pointer to another node,

\noindent A company specialising in bento boxes wishes to trial a
relational database management system to manage its data. It is expected
that the database should be normalised to third normal form (3NF).

\noindent The company owns four kiosks. For each of the kiosks, the
following information is to be recorded in the table \texttt{Kiosk}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{KioskID} -- the unique integer assigned to the kiosk 
\item \texttt{Location} -- the area where the kiosk is located 
\item \texttt{Rating} -- the average rating of the kiosk between 0.0 and
5.0 inclusive
\end{itemize}
\noindent The company offers eight different types of bento boxes.
Some of them may contain egg, nut, seafood or a combination of them.
For each of the bento boxes, the following information is to be recorded
in the table \texttt{BentoBox}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{BentoName} -- the unique name of the bento box 
\item \texttt{ProductionCost} -- the cost incurred in producing the bento
box in dollars and cents 
\item \texttt{ContainEgg} -- an integer 0 for not containing egg and 1
for containing egg 
\item \texttt{ContainNut} -- an integer 0 for not containing nut and 1
for containing nut 
\item \texttt{ContainSeafood} -- an integer 0 for not containing seafood
and 1 for containing seafood 
\end{itemize}
\noindent Each of the four kiosks sells all eight bento boxes at different
mark-up prices. Another table \texttt{KioskBento} is needed to record
the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{KioskID} -- the unique integer assigned to the kiosk 
\item \texttt{BentoName} -- the unique name of the bento box 
\item \texttt{SellPrice} -- the price at which the bento box is sold at
the kiosk in dollars and cents

box is given in the following order: \texttt{BentoName}, \texttt{ProductionCost},
\texttt{ContainEgg}, \texttt{ContainNut}, \texttt{ContainSeafood}

\noindent The mark-up price for each kiosk has been set as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{KioskID = 1} sells each bento box at a price that is \$2.60
higher than the production cost
\item \texttt{KioskID = 2} sells each bento box at a price that is \$2.90

\textbf{Task 1}

For this task, submit all code as \texttt{T1\_<index number>\_<name>.py}. 

The Taliban\textquoteright s takeover of Afghanistan had seen the
United States (US) evacuating people. The Republic of Singapore Air
Force offers its A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport plane (A330 MRTT)
to help the US airlift groups of evacuees from Afghanistan. 

\subsubsection*{Task 1.1 }

To prevent Taliban interference, messages sent between evacuees and
the A330 MRTT are encrypted. 

The encryption converts each character of the message into its ASCII
number representation, adds the ASCII number representation of a character
of a secret key which is in the same position, and then converts it
back into ASCII text. 

Secret keys are generated from passwords known only by the sender
and receiver. Passwords that are shorter in length than the message
are lengthened to match by repeating the password until the same length
as the message is achieved. 

For example, given that the inputs are 

\texttt{password : \textquotedbl cat\textquotedbl{} }

\texttt{message ~: \textquotedbl hello\textquotedbl} 

Step 1 - Extend password by repeating until matches length of message 

\texttt{\textquotedbl cat\textquotedbl{} -> \textquotedbl catca\textquotedbl{} }

Step 2 - Convert each character of password and message into ASCII
number representation 

\texttt{\textquotedbl hello\textquotedbl{} -> 104, 101, 108, 108,
111 }

\texttt{\textquotedbl catca\textquotedbl{} -> 99, 97, 116, 99, 97 }

Step 3 - Add the ASCII number representation of same positions together 

\texttt{104+99, 101+97, 108+116, 108+99, 111+97 -> 203, 198, 224,
207, 208 }

Step 4 - Convert each number to its ASCII character 

\texttt{203, 198, 224, 207, 208 -> \textquotedbl \textquotedbl{} }

Therefore, the results are 

\texttt{Secret key : \textquotedbl catca\textquotedbl{} }

\texttt{Encrypted message : \textquotedbl \textquotedbl{} }

Write a function \texttt{generateKey(password, message)} that takes
in two argument strings \texttt{message} and \texttt{password} and
returns the secret key. 

Test your function using \texttt{generateKey(\textquotedbl cat\textquotedbl ,
\textquotedbl hello\textquotedbl )} and show your output. \hfill{}{[}4{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.2 }

Write functions \texttt{encrypt(password, message)} and \texttt{decrypt(password,
message)} that takes in \texttt{password} and message strings and
returns the encrypted or decrypted \texttt{message}. It should use
the above function \texttt{generateKey(password, message)} to obtain
the secret key before performing the encryption. 

Test your function with \texttt{decrypt(\textquotedbl cat\textquotedbl ,
encrypt(\textquotedbl cat\textquotedbl ,\textquotedbl hello\textquotedbl ))}.
Show your output. \hfill{}{[}6{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.3 }

Since the A330 MRTT plane can only take a maximum of 266 passengers
at once, implement a \texttt{Queue} to manage incoming pickup requests
and dropoffs. Write a class Queue with the following methods: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{enqueue(string)} which takes in a string and adds it to the
queue or returns \texttt{\textquotedbl Queue is full!\textquotedbl}
if queue is full 
\item \texttt{dequeue} which removes the next item for the queue or returns
\texttt{\textquotedbl Queue is empty!\textquotedbl} if the queue
is empty 
\item \texttt{display} which returns a string of queue items in sequence
from head to tail or returns \texttt{\textquotedbl Queue is empty!\textquotedbl}
if the queue is empty
\item \texttt{current\_size} which returns an integer of the number of items
in the queue. \hfill{}{[}8{]}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.4 }

Using socket programming, write the client program for the evacuee
teams (client) in Afghanistan and the A330 MRTT plane (server) to
communicate. The program should 
\begin{itemize}
\item use the above queue data structure to manage the requests 
\item request the user to set a password for encryption at the start of
the program 
\item present the user with incoming pickup requests and pickup details
(Team name and group size) as well as queue details (size of current
queue) 
\item allow the user(server) to accept/reject pickup requests 
\item encrypt all information sent and received using \texttt{encrypt(password,
message)} and \texttt{decrypt(password, message)} functions. 
\end{itemize}
You are provided with the client program in \texttt{client.py}. Write
and submit the server program as \texttt{T1\_<index number>\_<name>.py}. 

Study the following sample program output to determine your code design,
output format and socket protocol. User inputs are underlined.

\textbf{Task 2} 

Name your Jupyter Notebook and save all parts for this task as 

\texttt{TASK2\_<index\_number>\_<name>.ipynb }

You will be writing a Math game program for Form Teachers to play
with students in school. The game auto-generates math expressions
and tracks scoring. 

\subsubsection*{Task 2.1 }

Using a stack data structure, write a function \texttt{solver(expr)}
that takes in a string of a mathematical expression expr such as \texttt{\textquotedbl ((1{*}7)+6)\textquotedbl}
and returns \texttt{13}. You may assume that the entire expression
would never have spaces, and would always be enclosed in an opening
and closing parenthesis \textquotedbl ( )\textquotedbl . Do not
use the built-in function \texttt{eval()}. Test your function with
\texttt{solver(\textquotedbl ((1{*}7)+6)\textquotedbl )} and show
your output. \hfill{}{[}6{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 2.2 }

Write a function \texttt{generate\_expression} that takes in an integer
\texttt{operator\_count} and returns a string of a mathematical expression
which has the specified number of operators (i.e. \texttt{+ - {*}
/} ) in \texttt{operator\_count}. The function should use \textbf{recursion}
to form up the operators and operands. The operands, operators and
positions of operands and operators should be random. 

For example, \texttt{generate\_expression(5)} would output \textquotedbl\texttt{(4{*}(6-(2+((1{*}7)+6))))}\textquotedbl{}
and \texttt{generate\_expression(5}) would output \textquotedbl\texttt{((8+(6+((2{*}4)-3)))+6)}\textquotedbl . 

Test your function with \texttt{generate\_expression(5)} and show
your output. \hfill{}{[}7{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 2.3 }

Implement the following using object-oriented programming: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Person}, a class, which 
\begin{itemize}
\item initialises with these attributes 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{name: string }
\item \texttt{gender: string} where male is \textquotedbl\texttt{M}\textquotedbl{}
and female is \textquotedbl\texttt{F}\textquotedbl{} 
\item \texttt{score: integer }

\item has the following methods 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{display\_info()} which displays the \texttt{Person}\textquoteright s
\texttt{name}, \texttt{gende}r and \texttt{score} 
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. eg \textquotedbl\texttt{Nelson(M)\textquoteright s score is 3.}\textquotedbl{}

\item \texttt{attempts()} which
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. uses the function \texttt{generate\_expression} from Task 2.2 to
generate and display a random math expression of 2 operators 
\item 2. queries the user to give an answer rounded up to the nearest integer 
\item 3. displays \textquotedbl\texttt{Good job!}\textquotedbl{} if the
input is correct or \textquotedbl\texttt{Wrong answer. (Correct

answer. 
\item 4. increases the score of the student by \texttt{1} if the answer
is correct 
\item 5. displays the user\textquoteright s latest \texttt{sc}ore 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{Student}, a subclass of \texttt{Person}, which 
\begin{itemize}
\item also has the following attribute 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{role: string} which is \textquotedbl\texttt{no role}\textquotedbl{}
by default unless the \texttt{Student} has a class committee role
such as \textquotedbl\texttt{chairperson}\textquotedbl{} 
\end{itemize}
\item also has the following methods 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{student\_role()} which returns a string describing the \texttt{role}
of the \texttt{Student}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{FormTeacher}, a subclass of \texttt{Person}, which 
\begin{itemize}
\item also has the following methods
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{display\_info()} which uses polymorphism to display the\texttt{
FormTeacher}\textquoteright s information with salutation to the FormTeacher\textquoteright s
name 
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. eg: \textquotedbl\texttt{Ms. Norah's score is 0}.\textquotedbl{}
where \textquotedbl\texttt{Norah}\textquotedbl{} is her name, and
\textquotedbl\texttt{Ms}.\textquotedbl{} corresponds to her gender.

\subsubsection*{Task 2.4}

Write driver code to test the earlier class you created. Also, create
\texttt{groups} which is a list that uses a 2-dimensional array to
store and associate each instance created below with his/her civics
group. Use this 2-dimensional array to display the scores of all persons
in each civics group indicating the student chairperson\textquoteright s
name (if any). Test your code with the following steps in order: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Create an instance of \texttt{Student} with \texttt{name} \textquotedbl\texttt{Melvin}\textquotedbl{}

\item Melvin attempts a math question 
\item Susan attempts a math question 
\item Jimmy attempts a math question 
\item Display the scores of all persons in each civics group with a header

The task is to implement a priority queue using Object-Oriented Programming. 

A priority queue is an extension of queue with the following properties. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Every element has a priority associated with it. Smaller integer value
has a higher priority. 
\item An element with high priority leaves the queue before an element with
low priority.
\item If two elements have the same priority, they are served according
to their order in the queue, i.e. the earlier element will be served
before the later element (FIFO). 
\end{itemize}

priority numbers. The patient with the highest priority is treated
first, regardless of the order of arrival.

Name your Jupyter Notebook as 

\texttt{TASK4\_<your name>\_<centre number>\_<index number>.ipynb }

The task is to write program code for a Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek game for
two players. 

Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek is a game played on a 4 x 4 square board. The board
starts empty, except that a single 'T' symbol may appear in one of
the 16 squares. There are two players: X and O. They take turns to
make moves, with X starting. In each move a player puts her symbol
in one of the empty squares. Player X's symbol is \texttt{'X'}, and
player O's symbol is \texttt{'O'}. 

After a player's move, if there is a row, column or a diagonal containing
4 of that player's symbols, or containing 3 of her symbols and the
\texttt{'T'} symbol, she wins and the game ends. Otherwise the game
continues with the other player's move. If all of the fields are filled
with symbols and nobody won, the game ends in a draw. 

Given the 4 x 4 board description containing \texttt{'X'}, \texttt{'O'},
\texttt{'T'} and \texttt{'.'} characters (where \texttt{'.'} represents
an empty square). The following examples show the various winning
positions.

JP Fitness Club is a gym that keeps details of its members. You are
tasked to help the club manage the members\textquoteright{} details
and store them in a SQL database. 

There are two types of membership: normal and annual. Each member
has a unique membership number, first name, surname, contact number
and last visit date recorded. 

A normal member deposits a selected amount into their account. Each
time the member visits the gym, the entrance fee is deducted from
the amount held in his account. The member may top up the account
any time. 

An annual member pays a fixed fee per year, starting from the date
of registration. He may then visit the gym any number of times for
the whole year without paying the entrance fee. 

Three classes have been identified: \texttt{Member}, \texttt{NormalMember},
\texttt{AnnualMember}. 

The class \texttt{Member} has these attributes and methods defined
on it. 

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Data type} & \textbf{Description}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{memberID} & String  & 8 digit membership number. First four digits represent the year of
joining gym and last four digits are used to make the \texttt{memberID}
unique, e.g. \texttt{20210357}. \tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{first\_name } & String  & First name of member, at most 15 characters.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{surname } & String  & Surname of member, at most 15 characters.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{contact\_number } & String  & 8 digit contact number.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{last\_visit } & String  & The date when member last visited the gym, in the format\texttt{ YYYY-MM-DD}.
Initialises to today\textquoteright s date. \tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{memberType} & String  & Indicates type of membership, either \textquotedblleft normal\textquotedblright{}
or \textquotedblleft annual\textquotedblright . Initialises to None. \tabularnewline
\hline 
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Return type} & \textbf{Description}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{showMember() } & None  & Outputs member\textquoteright s membership number, first name, surname,
contact number and last visit date.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{isActive() } & Boolean  & Indicates whether a member is active or not. Returns True if the last
visit date is within 30 days, otherwise returns False.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}

The class \texttt{NormalMember} inherits from \texttt{Member} and
has these additional attributes and methods defined on it. 

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Data type} & \textbf{Description}\tabularnewline
\hline

\texttt{showMember()} & None & Output \texttt{memberType} in addition to member\textquoteright s
membership number, first name, surname, contact number and last visit
date. \tabularnewline

The class \texttt{AnnualMember} also inherits from \texttt{Member}
and has these additional attributes and methods defined on it. 

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

\texttt{showMember()} & None & Outputs \texttt{memberType} in addition to member\textquoteright s
membership number, first name, surname, contact number and last visit
date. \tabularnewline

The task is to write a function that takes a sequence of characters
representing a colour, and translates the colour into a different
number base. 

8-bit colours are represented with three numbers, indicating the level
of the colours red (R), green (G), and blue (B) respectively. Each
number is an integer from 0 to 255. 255 represents the fully saturated
colour, while 0 represents zero saturation (black).

In HTML, these colours may be represented using hex code as well.
In hex code, the R, G, and B values are converted to hexadecimal.
Hex codes begin with the symbol \textquoteleft \#\textquoteright{}
followed by the three R, G, and B hexadecimal values. 

For example, the hex code \#0A0B0C represents a colour with RGB values
10, 11, and 12 respectively. 

For each of the sub-tasks, add a comment statement, at the beginning
of the code using the hash symbol \textquoteleft \#\textquoteright ,

\subsubsection*{Task 3.1 }

Write a function called \texttt{task3\_1(hex)} that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item takes \texttt{hex}, a string representing a hex code, beginning with
a \textquoteleft \#\textquoteright{} symbol followed by three valid
hexadecimal values between 00 and FF 
\item returns and displays either: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a 3-integer tuple representing RGB values 

or 
\item the error message, \textquotedbl\texttt{invalid data}\textquotedbl{}
\hfill{}{[}5{]}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For example, 

\texttt{task3\_1(\textquotedbl\#FFFFFF\textquotedbl ) }

should return and display \texttt{(255, 255, 255)}\hfill{} {[}3{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 3.2 }

Some image programs do not represent colours using 8-bit integers.
Instead, they represent them as a normalised float value. In this
representation, a value of 1.0 represents the fully saturated colour
and a value of 0 represents zero saturation (black). 

Write a second function \texttt{task3\_2(rgb)} that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item takes a 3-integer tuple rgb representing RGB values 
\item returns and displays either: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a 3-float tuple representing normalised RGB 

or 
\item the error message, \textquotedbl invalid data\textquotedbl{} \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\end{itemize}

Test the function fully with suitable test data. 

For example, 

\texttt{task3\_2((128, 128, 128))} 

should return and display\texttt{ (0.50196, 0.50196, 0.50196) }

\texttt{task3\_2((255, 255, 255)) }

should return and display\texttt{ (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)}\hfill{} {[}3{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 3.3 }

Image filters are functions that take in image data and change the
RGB values of its colours according to an algorithm. The algorithm
for converting an image to grayscale calculates the average of the
RGB values and sets the R, G, and B values to this average. 

Write a third function \texttt{task3\_3(hex)} that:
\begin{itemize}
\item takes hex, a string representing a hex code 
\item returns and displays a 3-float tuple representing normalised RGB of
the colour converted to grayscale \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\end{itemize}
Test the function fully with \textbf{two} suitable values.

For example, 

\texttt{task3\_3(\textquotedbl\#FF8000\textquotedbl ) }

should return and display \texttt{(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)}\hfill{} {[}2{]}

The implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) using three 1D arrays
is shown below. 

Each unused node that are not in the logical BST is initially connected
in a singly linked list manner using the \texttt{leftPtr} array. The
first position of this linked list is indicated by the variable \texttt{nextFree}. 

When a piece of data is inserted into the BST, a node will be disconnected
from the linked list and added to the logical BST. The root of this
logical BST is indicated by the variable \texttt{root}. The logical
structure of the BST is managed by \texttt{leftPtr} and \texttt{rightPtr}
which are the positions of the left and right child of the node respectively. 

Below is an illustration for such BST with a 0-based index array.

\item The attribute count is the number of nodes that lruq currently have.

Complete the least recently used queue class \texttt{LRUQ} by implementing
the \texttt{use} function. The class function \texttt{use(value)}
takes an integer \texttt{value} as input. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If \texttt{value} is in \texttt{lruq} (referenced by hashmap), it
removes the node in the \texttt{lruq} and re-insert it to the end
of the \texttt{lruq}. 
\item If \texttt{value} is not in \texttt{lruq} (not referenced by hashmap),
it references \texttt{value} in hashmap and inserts a new \texttt{Node}
instance with value as its data to the end of \texttt{lruq}. If \texttt{count}
> \texttt{size}, it removes the least recently used node in \texttt{lruq}
and de-references it in \texttt{hashmap}. 

Hint: To de-reference a key in \texttt{hashmap}, you can call the
following. \texttt{self.hashmap.pop(key, None)} where \texttt{self.hashmap}
is a dictionary object.

The following information of each \texttt{RentalRecord} is stored: 

\texttt{CustomerID} -- ID of customer. 

\texttt{VIN} -- VIN of car. 

\texttt{StartDate} -- start date for the rental service. 

\texttt{CollectionPointID} -- ID of the collection point. 

\texttt{ReturnDate} -- return date for the rental service.

\subsubsection*{Task 4.1 }

Create an SQL file called \texttt{Task4\_1.sql} to show the SQL code
to create the database \texttt{car\_rental.db} with the three tables. 

The table \texttt{Customer} must use \texttt{CustomerID} as its primary
key, the table \texttt{Car} must use \texttt{VIN} as its primary key,
and the table \texttt{RentalPoint} must use \texttt{PointID} as its
primary key. 

The table \texttt{RentalRecord} should use \texttt{CustomerID}, \texttt{VIN}
and \texttt{StartDate} as a composite key, while \texttt{CustomerID},
\texttt{VIN} and \texttt{CollectionPointID/ReturnPointID} must refer
to \texttt{CustomerID} in \texttt{Customer}, \texttt{VIN} in \texttt{Car}
and \texttt{PointID} in \texttt{RentalPoint} as foreign keys.

\subsubsection*{Task 4.4 }

The company wants to implement a function to register new cars for
rental into the database. Office staff can register new cars by adding
the values of the attributes in the \texttt{Car} table. 

Write a Python program and the necessary files to create a web application
that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Receive the following information: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{VIN}, \texttt{Brand}, \texttt{VehicleType}, \texttt{EnergySource},
and \texttt{DailyPrice} of a car through a HTML form.
\item \texttt{Availability} should be set to the default value of \texttt{'Available'}. 
\item Note that \texttt{VehicleType} and \texttt{EnergySource} should be
in \textbf{dropdown} list format to improve data validity. 
\end{itemize}
\item Check if the \texttt{VIN} is valid based on the following algorithm: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1: Translate all letters to integer values using the following
table (\texttt{I}, \texttt{O}, and \texttt{Q} are not allowed in a
valid \texttt{VIN}): 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{A}: 1  & \textbf{B}: 2  & \textbf{C}: 3  & \textbf{D}: 4  & \textbf{E}: 5  & \textbf{F}: 6  & \textbf{G}: 7  & \textbf{H}: 8  & \textbf{N/A}\tabularnewline

\hline 
\textbf{N/A}  & \textbf{S}: 2  & \textbf{T}: 3  & \textbf{U}: 4  & \textbf{V}: 5  & \textbf{W}: 6  & \textbf{X}: 7  & \textbf{Y}: 8 & \textbf{Z}: 9\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}
\item Step 2: Use the following weight factor for each position in the VIN.
\textbf{The 9th position is that of the check digit}. Its weight factor
has been substituted with a \texttt{0}, which will cancel it out in
the multiplication step. 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Position } & \textbf{1 } & \textbf{2 } & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} & \textbf{5} & \textbf{6} & \textbf{7} & \textbf{8} & \textbf{9} & \textbf{10} & \textbf{11} & \textbf{12} & \textbf{13} & \textbf{14} & \textbf{15} & \textbf{16} & \textbf{17}\tabularnewline
\hline 
Weight  & 8  & 7  & 6  & 5  & 4  & 3  & 2  & 10  & 0  & 9  & 8  & 7  & 6  & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}
\item The sum of product of the letter/digit with their corresponding weight
factor is then divided by \texttt{11}. 
\item The remainder is the check digit. If the remainder is \texttt{10},
the check digit will use \texttt{X} instead. 
\item E.g. the \texttt{VIN} with values 1\texttt{M8GDM9A\_KP042788} will
produce a check digit of \texttt{X} and hence \texttt{1M8GDM9AXKP042788}
is a valid \texttt{VIN}. 
\end{itemize}
\item If \texttt{VIN} is valid, create a new car record in the \texttt{Car}
table, and display the record in the confirmation page. 
\item Otherwise, inform the user that the VIN is invalid. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Github/question_bank/LyX/static/img/9569-RVHS-2021-P2-Q4}

You may assume: 
\begin{itemize}
\item All inputs are in valid format. 
\item VIN: 1M8GDM9AXKP042788 is a new record to the database 
\end{itemize}
Save your program as \texttt{Task4\_4.py }

A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) abstract data type (ADT) in
which all the elements are inserted and removed from one end. 

It is common to either use a linked list or an array to implement
a stack
\begin{itemize}
\item In the linked list implementation, a root pointer points to the top
of a stack and a data structure. The data structure contains the value
of the data and a pointer pointing to the next node in the stack. 
\item In the array implementation, a fixed size array is used to store the
elements. 
\end{itemize}
The basic stack operations of \texttt{push()}, \texttt{pop()} and
\texttt{peek()} are provided in both implementations. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{push()} is used to insert an element into the stack. 
\item \texttt{pop()} removes an element from the stack and returns the value
of the element. 
\item \texttt{peek()} returns the value of the element at the top of the
stack without removing it.

The Food Services Industry Digital Plan (IDP) was recently launched
by the Minister of State for Trade and Industry to help F\&B businesses
adopt more digital technologies in their daily operations. The manager
of a Iocal restaurant engaged a consultant to propose a digital solution
for his restaurant operations. 

After conducting a comprehensive study, the consultant proposed a
web-based solution using a client-server model. The solution requires
the following hardware to access the web server wirelessly in the
local area network (LAN): 
\begin{itemize}
\item A tablet device on each table for customers to browse the menu and
order their food items. 
\item Multiple large monitors for the chefs in the kitchen to read the ordered
food items. 
\item A computer station for the service staff to check the table number
before serving the food to the customers. 
\item A computer in the manager\textquoteright s office to update the menu
in the web server and print the daily sales report.

When a customer decides to pay the bill, a QR code will be generated
on the tablet device for him to scan and make online payment using
his personal mobile device.

A fantasy card game was developed using object-oriented programming
(OOP) to store its cards\textquoteright{} data. A card can either
be a minion or a weapon. Each card has a name, mana cost, health or
durability and attack power. 

In order to play a card, a player must spend a certain amount of mana
as specified in the card\textquoteright s mana cost. When the card
has been played, the player may decide whether to use it to attack
another minion or not. 

A minion may belong to one of the following races: beast, demon, dragon
or elemental. When a minion is attacked, its health would decrease
according to the attacking card\textquoteright s attack power. Once
the health of a minion decreases to zero, it is destroyed and removed
from the game. 

Instead of health, a weapon has durability and it cannot be attacked.
When a weapon is used for an attack, its durability would decrease
by one. Once the durability of a weapon decreases to zero, it is destroyed
and removed from the game.

\subsubsection*{Task 1.1 }

Write program code to implement the ADT \texttt{Person} with the above
constructor and accessors.\hfill{} {[}4{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.2 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{read\_file()} to read
all the 21 users\textquoteright{} information from the file \texttt{PEOPLE.csv}
and return a list containing all the \texttt{Person} ADTs.\hfill{}
{[}5{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.3 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{insertion\_sort(lst)}
that takes the list \texttt{lst} obtained from \textbf{Task 1.2} and
sort them according to their tag numbers in an ascending order using
the insertion sort algorithm.\hfill{} {[}5{]}

Searching for a tag number in a large list of users may be slow and
tedious. However, if the list is sorted, performing a binary search
would be more efficient. 

\subsubsection*{Task 1.4 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{search(lst,num)} that
searches for a tag number \texttt{num} in the sorted list \texttt{lst}
obtained from \textbf{Task 1.3}. The code should 
\begin{itemize}
\item perform a binary search on the sorted list. 
\item return the \texttt{Person} ADT if the tag number \texttt{num} exists.
Otherwise, return \texttt{None}. 
\item print the number of comparisons made in the searching process.\hfill{}

Every user is required to carry a tracing token inside an indoor sports
facility so that the sensing device system can detect the token to
read the position of the users and their temperature. The data is
stored as records in the file \texttt{POSRECORDS.txt}, with the following
entries separated by commas: 
\begin{itemize}
\item the tag number (\texttt{INTEGER}) of the tracing token which could
be used to identify the user 
\item the temperature (\texttt{FLOAT}) of the user measured in degree Celsius 
\item the location $(x,y)$\texttt{ (FLOAT,FLOAT)} of the user which consists
of the perpendicular \texttt{x-} and \texttt{y-}distances, measured
in metres, from the walls A and B respectively 
\end{itemize}
The diagram below shows two locations $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$:

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Github/question_bank/LyX/static/img/9569-YIJC-2021-P2-Q2}
\par\end{center}

The distance between two locations can be calculated using the formula: 

\[
\text{Distance}=\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}
\]


\subsubsection*{Task 2.1 }

Create an empty array \texttt{all\_records} of size 20 and paste the
data from the text file \texttt{POSRECORDS.txt} into your program
code. 

Write program code for the function \texttt{distance(user1,user2)}
that takes in two records and returns the distance between the two
users in metres, correct to 2 decimal places. \hfill{} {[}3{]}

For safety reasons during the Covid-19 pandemic, two users are considered
to be in close proximity if the distance between them is less than
1.5 m apart. 

\subsubsection*{Task 2.2 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{analyse(user1)} that iterates
through all the records in the array \texttt{all\_records}, calculates
the distances between \texttt{user1} and all other users in the array,
and returns a list of tag numbers of the users who are in close proximity
to \texttt{user1}. \hfill{} {[}5{]}

Under the Safe Management Measures, people with a temperature of more
than 37.5 degree Celsius will be flagged out as RED cases and the
people who are in close proximity to these RED cases will be flagged
out as YELLOW cases. The facility manager needs to submit both lists
to the authority daily for follow-up actions. 

\subsubsection*{Task 2.3 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{red\_list(all\_records)}
that iterates through all the records in the array \texttt{all\_records}
and returns a list of tag numbers belonging to the RED cases. \hfill{}
{[}2{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 2.4 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{yellow\_list(red\_cases,all\_records)}
that iterates through all the records in the array \texttt{all\_records}
to check for people who were in close proximity to any of the RED
cases. The function returns a list of tag numbers belonging to the
YELLOW cases. 

Those people flagged out as RED cases in \textbf{Task 2.3} should
not appear in the list of YELLOW cases even though they may be in
close proximity to another RED case. 

You may use the functions written in Task 2.1 and Task 2.2 for the
program code in this task. \hfill{} {[}5{]}

Lessonology is a learning management system that utilises gamification
elements to motivate students to complete their assignments. The Linked
List data structure is used to store the students\textquoteright{}
names and their total experience points. Each node contains a student\textquoteright s
name, the student\textquoteright s total experience points, and a
pointer to the next node. The nodes are linked together according
to the order provided in the \texttt{DATA.txt} file. 

A program is to be written to implement nodes as an instance of the
class \texttt{Node}. The class \texttt{Node} has the following properties
and method: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline 
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\texttt{Class: Node}}\tabularnewline

\hline 
\texttt{Display()} & Display the current content of the linked list in table form.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Task 4.1 }

Write program code for the classes \texttt{Node} and \texttt{StudentList},
including the \texttt{Constructor},\texttt{ Add() }and \texttt{Display()}
methods. The code should follow the specification given. Do not write
the \texttt{Update()} and \texttt{Delete()} methods yet. 

The \texttt{Add(node)} method for the \texttt{StudentList} class should
add the \texttt{node} containing a student\textquoteright s name and
the student\textquoteright s total experience points to the linked
list, according to the order given in the \texttt{DATA.txt} file. 

Test your code by reading the data from the file \texttt{DATA.txt}
and adding them as nodes into the linked list. The diagram below shows
a portion of the expected output when using the \texttt{Display()}
method on the populated linked list: 
\noindent \begin{center}

\subsubsection*{Task 4.2 }

Each time a student completes an assignment, points will be awarded
and the student\textquoteright s total experience points will be updated. 

Write program code for the \texttt{Update(name,points)} method for
the \texttt{StudentList} class that takes a student\textquoteright s
\texttt{name} and the awarded \texttt{points} as inputs to update
the student\textquoteright s total experience points in the node.
(You may assume that the node containing the student exists in the
linked list.) 

For example, \texttt{Update('BRIAN',100)} will update the total experience
points of a student whose name is \texttt{'BRIAN'} from \texttt{20404}
to \texttt{20504}. \hfill{}{[}3{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 4.3 }

Write program code to implement the \texttt{Delete(name)} method for
the \texttt{StudentList} class to search and remove a node, containing
a particular student\textquoteright s \texttt{name}, in the linked
list. Return \texttt{True} if the node is found and removed; otherwise
return \texttt{False}. (You may assume that the students\textquoteright{}
names are unique in the linked list.) \hfill{}{[}4{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 4.4 }

Another linked list which has pointers linking the nodes in decreasing
order of the experience points is implemented as an instance of the
class \texttt{Leaderboard}. 

The class \texttt{Leaderboard} has the following properties and methods:

\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Methods}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{\hspace{0.01\columnwidth}}Identifier & \texttt{\hspace{0.05\columnwidth}}Description\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Constructor} & Inherit the property and all the methods from the class \texttt{StudentList}.
Initialise the linked list with the pointer \texttt{Start} assigned
to \texttt{None}.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Add()} & Modify the \texttt{Add()} method in the parent class to add a new
node in decreasing order of total experience points.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Update()} & Modify the \texttt{Update()} method in the parent class such that
the linked list is still in decreasing order of experience points
after updating a student\textquoteright s total experience points.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{DisplayTop()} & Display the content of the nodes in the linked list for the top students
based on their total experience points.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

Write program code for the class \texttt{Leaderboard} to inherit the
properties and methods from the class \texttt{StudentList} with the
modified \texttt{Add()} and \texttt{Update()} methods. The additional
\texttt{DisplayTop(n)} method should display the top \texttt{n} number
of students in the linked list, based on their total experience points.
(You may assume that no two students have the same total experience
points.) 

Test your code by reading the data from the file \texttt{DATA.txt}
and adding them as nodes into this linked list. The diagram below
shows the expected output when using the \texttt{DisplayTop(5)} method
on the linked list:
