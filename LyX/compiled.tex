The Pioneer Generation Joint Committee (PGJC) is a diverse taskforce
set up to manage and promote information about the Pioneer Generation
Package (PGP) to honour and thank pioneers for their hard work and
dedication to make Singapore what it is today. The PGP will benefit
about 450,000 Singaporeans. 

Beyond the conventional means of raising awareness of PGP via mainstream
media (newspapers and television broadcast), PGJC also desires to
enhance its outreach using the Internet, new media (e.g. social networks)
and mobile applications. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Give two advantages of using the latter modes of outreach compared
to traditional mass media. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item A significant challenge of using non-conventional outreach methods
is that while the Internet and mobile devices are becoming increasingly
ubiquitous, many user interfaces are often not well suited to the
elderly's specific needs. 

Design and justify an appropriate user interface for a pioneer to
enter information to file for hospitalisation claim on an insurance
company's website using a desktop or laptop computer. The information
required are: NRIC, hospital name, from and to dates of hospitalisation,
invoice number, invoice amount and brief description of reason for
hospitalisation. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Give two factors developers would need to consider to adapt the user
interface for a mobile device such as a smartphone. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item The development of the PGP mobile application will involve the following
phases:

A normalised database solution is to be designed, which has a number

To enhance the security of online transactions, a one-time randomly
generated 5-digit Personal Identification Number (PIN) will be sent
to the user's registered mobile phone number as part of the authentication
process. The security algorithm, \texttt{Secret()}, makes use of the
sum of squares of the prime factors of the rightmost 5 digits of the
user's mobile number modulo $k$, where $k$ is a randomly generated
prime in the range 100000 -- 999999. 

As an illustration, consider the mobile phone number 87654321 ($n=54321$):

Sum of squares of prime factors of $n=3^{2}+19^{2}+953^{2}=908579$

PIN = 908579 modulo $k$ (let's say $k=102077$) = 91963 

So a one-time 5-digit PIN 91963 will be sent to the mobile number
87654321. 

The algorithm for finding the prime factors of a number n is detailed
recursively as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $n$ is even, one factor is 2, then find the prime factors of n/2. 
\item If $n$ is divisible by 3, remove this factor and then find the prime
factors of the remainder. 
\item If $n$ is divisible by 5, remove this factor and then find the prime
factors of the remainder. 
\item If $n$ is divisible by 7, remove this factor and then find the prime
factors of the remainder. 
\item ...
\end{itemize}
You may assume the availability of a random function \texttt{Random()}
but should indicate how it is used. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify, giving examples, any pitfall(s) with your \texttt{Secret()}
algorithm, and suggest possible solution(s) to overcome them. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Devise, incorporating your answer to (a), an efficient means of generating
a PIN using \texttt{Secret()}. Your function should include a recursive
algorithm for finding the prime factors of n. State explicitly any
necessary assumption(s) made. \hfill{}{[}6{]}

this context compared to traditional face-to-face interaction and
online communication means such as email and instant messaging.\hfill{}
{[}3{]} 
\item Give two benefits and one concern of hosting the social network using

Pioneers who are eligible for the PGP must meet the following conditions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item still alive 
\item Aged 16 and above in 1965 
\item obtained citizenship on or before 31 December 1986

Mailing information of the pioneers is currently held in a sequential
file in NRIC order: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{<NRIC><Statutory name><Address line><Postal code> }
\par\end{center}

Postal code is a 6-digit string representing the geographic location
of an address. To mail the PGP information to the pioneers efficiently,
three methods are proposed: 
\begin{itemize}
\item M1 - Sort the contents of the sequential file using quick sort on
the postal code field. 
\item M2 - Reorganise the contents of the sequential file to a linked list
of linked lists in ascending postal code order. Each node of the linked
list points to a linked list of addresses with the same postal code. 
\item M3 - Reorganize the contents of the sequential file to a binary search
tree using postal code as the key field. Each node in the binary search
tree points to a linked list of addresses with the same postal code. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(c)]  Why is quick sort appropriate or inappropriate for method M1? \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item[(d)]  Draw diagrams to represent the scenario in 
\begin{enumerate}
\item method M2 using linked list 
\item method M3 using binary tree

Morse Code is a type of code in which letters are represented by combinations
by long or short signals, e.g. the letter \textquoteleft A\textquoteright{}
is represented by a short followed by a long signal, i.e. \textquoteleft .-\textquoteleft{} 

Here we use the period (\textquoteleft .\textquoteright ) to represent
the short signal and the dash (\textquoteleft -\textquoteleft ) to
present the long signal. The Morse code equivalent for the letters
\textquoteleft A\textquoteright{} to \textquoteleft Z\textquoteright{}
is provided in the file \texttt{MORSE.txt}. In this implementation,
we use a space (\textquoteleft{} \textquoteleft ) to simulate the
inter-character gap and the slash (\textquoteleft /\textquoteright )
to represent the inter-word gap.

Many programming languages use a variety of brackets eg \texttt{()},
\texttt{\{\}} and \texttt{{[}{]}} in their program statement constructs.
Brackets can be nested e.g. (()) and \{{[}{]}\}. A well-formed construct
must contain a matched set of optionally nested brackets e.g.\texttt{ (())},
\texttt{\{{[}{]}\}} and \texttt{()\{\}{[}{]}} are well-formed whereas\texttt{
(()},\texttt{ \{{]} }and\texttt{ )( }are not. 

An efficient way to check if a program construct is well-formed is
to use a stack to scan the brackets once from left to right as follows: 

Start from an empty stack. Whenever we encounter an open bracket,
push it into the stack. Whenever we encounter a close bracket, we
check if it is of the same type with the item at the top of the stack.
Once we have a match, we pop the topmost bracket from the stack. Only
when we managed to read the last bracket and find that the stack is
empty, then we know that the brackets are properly nested, and the
program construct is well-formed. 

The stack ADT contains character data and a top pointer, and has the
following operations: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Create()} : initializes a new stack 
\item \texttt{Push(item)} : add item to top of stack 
\item \texttt{Pop()} : remove item from top of stack 
\item \texttt{Peep()} : inspect the topmost item of stack 
\item \texttt{isEmpty()} : check if stack is empty 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Task 4.1 }

ADT using the class name \texttt{Stack}.

output the diagnostic message \texttt{\textquotedbl Expecting '('\textquotedbl}.

All\textquoteright s Well Hospital is in the process of computerizing
its clinic processes. At the clinic, there are various doctors specializing
in different areas e.g. neuroscience specialists, gynaecologists,
etc. All patients of the clinic must be registered in the patient
database and make prior appointments to see the relevant doctors.
No walk-in patients will be entertained. Appointments are made based
on the doctor\textquoteright s weekly schedule i.e. different doctors
have clinic sessions at different day/time of the week. 

On the day of appointment, patients are to register at the self-registration
counter before proceeding to the doctor\textquoteright s room. Upon
seeing the doctor, the doctor will input the diagnosis into the system.
After the doctor\textquoteright s consultation, the patient is to
proceed to make payment. Upon payment, a prescription slip, reference
letter, medical certificate, will be printed as necessary for the
patient. In addition, the next appointment may be scheduled, if necessary. 
\begin{enumerate}

Implement a linked list to store names of runners and their best running
times in seconds, in ascending order of running time. The runner with
the fastest timing is stored at the first node while the runner with
the slowest timing is stored at the last node. A linked list of free
nodes is also implemented with a maximum size of 20 nodes. 

The program will use a user-defined type \texttt{Node} for each node
defined as follows: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline 
\texttt{\textbf{\hspace{0.01\columnwidth}}}\textbf{Identifier} & \texttt{\textbf{\hspace{0.01\columnwidth}}}\textbf{Data Type} & \texttt{\textbf{\hspace{0.05\columnwidth}}}\textbf{Description}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Name} & \texttt{STRING} & The name of the runner\tabularnewline

\hline 
\texttt{Next} & \texttt{POINTER} & The pointer to the next node \tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

The program will also use another user-defined type \texttt{LinkedList}
for each linked list. It contains a \texttt{first} pointer that points
to the first node of the linked list and makes use of \texttt{Node}
for its nodes. 

The user-defined type LinkedList contains methods as follows: 
\begin{center}

A message is encrypted and passed between two parties. To decrypt
the message, a \textquotedblleft key\textquotedblright{} is applied.
Both the sending and receiving parties hold the key which enables
them to encrypt and decrypt the message. 

An approach of cryptography is the simple substitution cipher, a method
of encryption by which each letter of a message is substituted with
another letter. The receiving party deciphers the text by performing
an inverse substitution. 

The substitution system is created by first writing out a \emph{phrase}.
The key is then derived from the phrase by removing all the repeated
letters. The \emph{cipher text} alphabet is then constructed starting
with the letters of the \emph{key} and then followed by all the remaining
letters in the alphabet. 

Using this system, the phrase \textquotedbl\texttt{apple}\textquotedbl{}
gives us the key as \textquotedbl\texttt{APLE}\textquotedbl{} and
the following substitution scheme: 

\begin{tabular}{cccccccccccccccccccccccccccc}
\textbf{Plain text alphabet :} & a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h & i & j & k & l & m & n & o & p & q & r & s & t & u & v & w & x & y & z & \tabularnewline
 & $\downarrow$ &  &  & $\downarrow$ & \multicolumn{21}{c}{$\cdots$$\cdots$$\cdots$$\cdots$$\cdots$$\cdots$$\cdots$$\cdots$} & $\downarrow$ & is substituted by\tabularnewline
\textbf{Cipher text alphabet :} & A & P & L & E & B & C & D & F & G & H & I & J & K & M & N & O & Q & R & S & T & U & V & W & X & Y & Z & \tabularnewline
\end{tabular}

\texttt{'a'} will be substituted by \texttt{'A'}, \texttt{'b'} will
be substituted by \texttt{'P'}, \texttt{'c'} will be substituted by
\texttt{'L'}, \texttt{'d'} will be substituted by\texttt{ 'E'},\texttt{
'e' }will be substituted by \texttt{'B'}, and so on.

A manual system for producing school student reports works in the
following manner: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a subject report is completed for each subject that a student takes
by the single teacher teaching that subject; 
\item to help the subject teacher, initially a blank report form is issued
to the student for the student to add their details: student NRIC,
name, contact phone, teacher and class; 
\item the subject report is completed by the teacher with appropriate comments; 
\item all subject reports for the student are passed to the student's tutor; 
\item the tutor puts all the subject reports together to form the student's
report folder; 
\item the tutor adds a tutor's report including attendance data supplied
by the school administration attendance records; 
\item each student's report folder is copied; 
\item the copy is filed in the report storage facility for the school; 
\item the report folder is sent to the student's parents. 
\end{itemize}
The school has decided to replace this manual system with a computerised
system. 

A system developer is employed to carry out the task. The first task
assigned to the system developer is to write a project proposal.
\begin{enumerate}
\item One section of the project proposal is the Problem Statement which
lists the problems in the current system. Write the Problem Statement.\hfill{}
{[}4{]}
\item The proposal is accepted and the main stages of the project have been
identified and durations assessed as follows:

International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique number assigned
to each edition of a book. It has two formats: ISBN-10 and ISBN-13.
The former is used before 1 Jan 2007 and the latter after that. Examples
of valid ISBNs are 020103803X and 978-1-284-05591-7. The last digit
is the check digit and is computed as follows:

\textbf{ISBN check digit (10 digits) - mod 11 algorithm} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Each digit starting from left to right is assigned a weight from 1
to 9. Each digit is multiplied by its position weight. The sum of
products modulo 11 gives a remainder between 0 and 10. If the remainder
is 10, the check digit is the roman numeral X, else the check digit
is the remainder.
\item \textbf{Example ISBN-10: 0-07-063546-3 }

$(0\times1)+(0\times2)+(7\times3)+(0\times4)+(6\times5)+(3\times6)+(5\times7)+(4\times8)+(6\times9)=190$
\item $190\mod11=3$
\item Hence 3 is the check digit. 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{ISBN check digit (13 digits) - mod 10 algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each digit starting from the left to right is multiplied by 1 or 3
alternatively. The sum of the products modulo 10 gives a remainder
between 0 to 9. If the remainder is nonzero, subtract this from 10
to get the check digit, else the check digit is 0. 
\item Example ISBN-13: 978-0-07-063546-3 

$1\times9+3\times7+1\times8+3\times0+1\times0+3\times7+1\times0+3\times6+1\times3+3\times5+1\times4+3\times6=117$
\item $117\mod10=7$
\item $10-7=3$ 
\item Hence 3 is the check digit.

Some game tournament such as badminton, bridge, chess, Pokemon, Scabble,
and many eSports employ the Swiss system of play, in which players
are not eliminated after each round and are paired with players with
the same number of wins or as close as possible. The following shows
an example of a 16-player Scrabble tournament. Assume that all games
have a winner and there are no draws. 

First round pairing is by random draw i.e there will be 8 random pairs.
After round 1, there will be a group of 8 players with a score of
1 (win), and a group of 8 players with a score of 0 (loss). 

For the second round, players in each scoring group will be paired
against each other -- 1\textquoteright s versus 1\textquoteright s
and 0\textquoteright s versus 0\textquoteright s.

After round 2, there will be three scoring groups: 
\begin{itemize}
\item 4 players who have won both games and have 2 points 
\item 8 players who have won a game and lost a game and have 1 point
\item 4 players who have lost both games and have no points. 
\end{itemize}
Again, for the third round, players are paired with players in their
scoring group. After round 3, the typical scoring groups will be: 
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 players who have won 3 games (3 points) 
\item 6 players with 2 wins (2 points) 
\item 6 players with 1 win (1 point) 
\item 2 players with no wins (0 points) 
\end{itemize}
For the fourth (and in this case final) round, the process repeats,
and players are matched with others in their scoring group. Note that
there are only 2 players who have won all of their games so far --
they will be matched against each other for the \textquotedbl championship\textquotedbl{}
game. After the final round, we will have something that looks like
this: 
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 player with 4 points -- the winner! 
\item 4 players with 3 points -- tied for second place
\item 6 players with 2 points 
\item 4 players with 1 point 
\item 1 player with 0 points 
\end{itemize}
The Swiss system produces a clear winner in just a few rounds, no
one is eliminated and almost everyone wins at least one game, but
there are many ties to deal with. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Propose and justify a suitable data structure to store and initialise

A message is encrypted and passed between two parties. To decrypt
the message, a \textquotedblleft key\textquotedblright{} is applied.
Both the sending and receiving parties hold the key which enables
them to encrypt and decrypt the message. 

An approach of cryptography is the simple substitution cipher, a method
of encryption by which each letter of a message is substituted with
another letter. The receiving party deciphers the text by performing
an inverse substitution. 

The substitution system is created by first writing out a \texttt{\emph{phrase}}.
The \texttt{\emph{key}} is then derived from the \texttt{\emph{phrase}}
by removing all the repeated letters. The \texttt{\emph{cipher text}}
alphabet is then constructed starting with the letters of the key
and then followed by all the remaining letters in the alphabet. 

Using this system, the phrase \textquotedbl\texttt{apple}\textquotedbl{}
gives us the \texttt{\emph{key}} as \textquotedbl\texttt{APLE}\textquotedbl{}
and the following substitution scheme: 

\begin{tabular}{lccccccccccccccccccccccccccc}
\textbf{Plain text alphabet:} & \texttt{a} & \texttt{b} & \texttt{c} & \texttt{d} & \texttt{e} & \texttt{f} & \texttt{g} & \texttt{h} & \texttt{i} & \texttt{j} & \texttt{k} & \texttt{l} & \texttt{m} & \texttt{n} & \texttt{o} & \texttt{p} & \texttt{q} & \texttt{r} & \texttt{s} & \texttt{t} & \texttt{u} & \texttt{v} & \texttt{w} & \texttt{x} & \texttt{y} & \texttt{z} & \tabularnewline

Your company is starting the development of relational database for
a patient billing system to be marketed to private medical practices
in Singapore. The system is to be called PATMAN (short for PATient
billing MANager), and is to run as a remote client-server system and
a local area network. 

An initial analysis phase of the project has resulted in the following
description of the relevant data for PATMAN. 
\begin{itemize}
\item A practice has a number of patients and doctors. 
\item Doctors are identified by name.
\item Each patient has a number used to identify the patient called the
OHIP number, a name and an age.
\item Each patient is either a male or female and has a next of kin identified
by name.
\item Each medical procedure paid by the government of Singapore is identified
by a procedure code and has a description and a charging category.
\item Each charging category has a dollar value. 
\item Each patient has a number of billing records, with each billing record
recording the medical procedure, the date on which the procedure was
performed, the examining doctor and some additional comments on the
part of the examining doctor.
\item Billing records are either outstanding or paid in full.

HC university has various campuses around the city and Wilson Parking
is responsible for all the university car parks.

At each car park:

A car arriving triggers a sensor (S1) and a fixed fee (F) is paid
into a machine. This allows a barrier (B1) to be lifted and the car
to enter the car park. When a car leaves the car park it passes over
another sensor (S2) and another barrier (B2) is lifted. 

Each car park has a maximum number of spaces for cars (M) and when
this maximum is reached a \textquotedblleft FULL\textquotedblright{}
sign is illuminated at the entrance and the barrier (B1) will not
rise. The car park is closed at least once a day for cleaning purposes. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write an algorithm which will control the barriers and which will
keep a total (T) of the fees paid. \hfill{}{[}8{]}

There are 100 car parks, each of which is identified by a number between
1 and 100. 

At the end of each month, the total fees paid for that month (T) is
collected from each of the car parks as an integer value. 

All data are stored in an array Parks(). 
\begin{itemize}
\item For car park x, Parks(x, 1) to Parks(x, 12) contains the totals for
the twelve months of the year.
\item Parks(x, 13) contain the annual total fees collected for each car
park.
\end{itemize}
\item Using Parks(x,y) to identify individual values in the array, write
an algorithm which can be used to produce the annual totals once the
twelve monthly totals have been input to the array, and the grand
annual total for all the 100 carparks. \hfill{}{[}5{]}

A stack can be used to evaluate an arithmetic expression. An arithmetic
expression can first be converted from infix notation to postfix notation,
then the postfix notation can be evaluated to get the value of the
infix notation. 

For example, the infix notation \texttt{5 {*} (6 + 2) - 12 / 4} can
first be converted to postfix notation \texttt{5 6 2 + {*} 12 4 /
-}, and then evaluated to \texttt{37} using a stack. 

The following is an algorithm for converting infix notation to postfix
notation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]  Create an empty stack called \texttt{opStack} for keeping operators. 
\item[2.]  Scan the token list from left to right. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If the token is an operand, append it to the end of the output list. 
\item If the token is a left parenthesis, push it on the \texttt{opStack}. 
\item If the token is an operator, \texttt{{*}, /, +}, or \texttt{-}, push
it on the \texttt{opStack}. However, first remove any operators already
on the \texttt{opStack} that have higher or equal precedence and append
them to the output list. 
\item If the token is a right parenthesis, pop the \texttt{opStack} until
the corresponding left parenthesis is removed. Append each operator
to the end of the output list. 
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
When the input expression has been completely processed, check the
\texttt{opStack}. Any operators still on the stack can be removed
and appended to the end of the output list.

PJ Parcels is a company that specialises in the delivery and collection
of parcels for business customers. To use their services, a customer
must first register for an account. The customer needs to provide
their company name, address, telephone number and the name of a main
contact for any queries. 

As part of the registration process, the customer will have to decide
if they wish to pay monthly on receipt of an invoice, or via credit
card for each delivery made. If paying by credit card, then the card
details are also required. Once these details have been accepted,
the customer will be issued with an account number that they must
quote when contacting the company. 

When a customer requires a parcel to be delivered, they will contact
PJ Parcels to arrange collection. The customer needs to provide details
of where the parcel will be collected from; where it will be delivered
to; how many parcels are to be collected and which type of service
they want, for example, next day delivery. 

Once the collection has been arranged, an Airway Bill will be generated.
The details on this will be used by a Dispatcher to schedule the vehicle
needed for the collection. Each parcel will be given a priority number
by the Dispatcher and those with the highest priority will be collected
first. 

By 12 noon each day, the Dispatcher also needs to generate a delivery
schedule to ensure all the parcels are delivered according to the
service required.

Each Driver has a mobile device with a copy of the Airway Bill; a
person at the delivery address must sign this to say that the parcel
has been delivered. This will flag that the delivery has been completed. 

Once the parcel has been delivered, if the customer pays via credit
card, their card will be debited by the amount required, or if they
pay monthly, then the invoice account will be debited. Once a month,
the Finance Department will generate the invoices for payment. 

If the parcel cannot be delivered for any reason, it will be returned
to the Depot and a card will be left with at the delivery address
with details of how to arrange re-delivery.

The company has decided to replace this manual system with an on-line
computerised system. 

A \textbf{system developer} is employed to carry out the task. The

In Olympic diving, scoring is done by a panel comprising a minimum
of 3 judges. The highest and lowest scores are dropped to eliminate
the extremes. The raw score is computed by summing the middle scores.
The raw score is then multiplied by the level of difficulty to give
the total score. 

Sample scoring for a 5-judges panel: Scores: 

6.5, 6, 6.5, 6, 5.5 

Lowest (5.5) and highest (6.5) scores dropped 

Raw Score = 18.5 (6.5 + 6 + 6) 

Total Score = Score (18.5) x Difficulty Level (1.5) = 27.75

A Pokemon Go fan who nicknames himself Pokeboy wishes to manage his
Pokemon collection using a binary search tree. Each binary search
tree node stores the name together with the numbers of that particular
Pokemon and candies collected, as well as a reference to a linked
list. Each linked list node stores the combat power (CP) of a Pokemon.
The binary search tree is organised in ascending Pokemon name order.
Each linked list is organised in descending order of CP. For ease
of reference, we shall name this composite data structure Poketree. 

\subsection*{Task 3.1 }

Using object-oriented programming, construct appropriate classes to
initialise, insert and display the contents of the Poketree. In your
main driver program, write code to initialise a Poketree with the
first Pokemon collected which is randomly generated from the contents
in the file \texttt{POKEMONS.TXT} as well as a randomly generated
CP in the range 10 to 200 inclusive. When a Pokemon is caught, 3 candies

the Poketree and its new incarnation either inserted (if its kind
is not previously collected) or updated (if its kind is previously
collected) to the Poketree. Evolving also requires a set amount and
type of Pokemon candy. If there is insufficient Pokemon candies, Pokeboy's
preferred action is to exchange (i.e. delete) existing Pokemons of
the same species for candies, starting from the Pokemon with the lowest
CP. Each Pokemon can be exchanged for one candy. Pokeboy also wishes
to keep at least 2 Pokemons of the same species in his collection

The current GovBuy prototype supports two types of reverse auctions:
a standard reverse auction and a sealed bid auction. 

A standard reverse auction is one where bids begin at \$5,000. The
lowest possible bid is \$1, and an auction automatically ends once
a \$1 bid has been submitted. Bidders are allowed to submit multiple
bids throughout the duration of the auction. Bidders will see whether
they are the winning bidder after submitting a bid, and will have
an opportunity to submit a lower bid if the auction is still running.
The GitHub user names of participating bidders are hidden during the
auction. At the end of the auction, all bidders' GitHub accounts and
bid amounts will be unsealed and posted on the GovBuy platform. A
sealed bid auction is a type of reverse auction. Each bidder is allowed
to submit only one bid in an auction. Once a bid is submitted, the
bidder may not submit a second bid for the same auction. The lowest
bidder at the conclusion of the auction will still win the auction.
In the event that one or more bidders have the same bid amount, the
bidder who was first to submit the lowest bid amount will win the
auction. All bids will stay sealed until the end of the auction. A
bidder will not know the amounts other bidders have bidded on the
auction, or how many bids have been submitted. At the end of the auction,
all bidders' GitHub accounts and bid amounts will be unsealed and
posted on the GovBuy platform.

A \textbf{\emph{palindrome}} is an integer that reads the same backwards
and forwards -- so 6, 11 and 121 are all palindromes, while 10, 12,
223 and 2244 are not (even though 010=10, we don't consider leading
zeroes when determining whether a number is a palindrome). 

A \textbf{\emph{fair and square}} number is an integer that is a \emph{palindrome}
\textbf{and} the \emph{square of a palindrome} at the same time. For
instance, 1, 9 and 121 are fair and square (being palindromes and
squares, respectively, of 1, 3 and 11), while 16, 22 and 676 are not
fair and square: 16 is \textbf{not} a palindrome, 22 is not a square,
and while 676 is a palindrome and a square number, it is the square
of 26, which is not a palindrome.

A transport company has a number of vehicles which can carry passengers.
Each vehicle is classified either as a bus or as a coach. All vehicles
have a registration number and have a certain number of seats for
the passengers. A bus can have a maximum number of standing passengers,
but a coach is not allowed to carry any standing passengers. Some
of the coaches are fitted with seat belts, but seat belts are never
fitted in a bus.

The transport company currently has a data file,\texttt{ VEHICLE.dat},
stores the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{RegNo} is used to uniquely identify a particular vehicle.
A typical vehicle registration number comes in the format \textquotedbl SBA1234\textquotedbl :
\begin{itemize}
\item S -- vehicle class (\textquotedbl S\textquotedbl{} stands for a
private vehicle) 
\item BA -- alphabetical series (\textquotedbl I\textquotedbl{} and \textquotedbl O\textquotedbl{}
are not used to avoid confusion with \textquotedbl 1\textquotedbl{}
and \textquotedbl 0\textquotedbl ) 
\item 1234 -- numerical series 
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{NoOfSeats} is the maximum number of seats for passengers that
each vehicle can carry. 
\item \texttt{VehicleType} is the type of the vehicle and can take one of
the two values: \textquoteleft \texttt{B}\textquoteright{} for a bus
and \textquoteleft C\textquoteright{} for a coach. 
\end{itemize}
\texttt{VEHICLE.dat} has the following structure:

additional data:

\item MaxStanding 
\item SeatBeltsFitted

Write code to read a record from \texttt{VEHICLE.dat} and write the
updated record to \texttt{UVEHICLE.dat}.

As the data on each vehicle is read it should be displayed and the
user should be allowed to input the additional data required.

The user should be prompted to input the data item appropriate to
the type of vehicle.

The number of standing passengers is never more than 15.

For a \textquoteleft \texttt{C}\textquoteright{} type vehicle the
\texttt{MaxStanding} field should contain a zero value. 

The \texttt{SeatBeltsFitted} field should contain an appropriate value.

There is a stock of 2000 different book titles and multiple copies
of popular titles. Books may be hired by members. Different rates
are charged for different books. Members are allowed to hire no more
than 5 items at anytime. 

Members can enjoy a light snack while viewing their favourite book.
If the book is returned the same day via the book drop, hire charges
are not incurred. All food and hire charges incurred for the month
is billed to the member every 12th of the following month. Cash transaction
is not available. 

The shop owner wishes to computerize the system to handle the various
transactions and stock control. The system should also perform the
following functions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Hold up-to-date details of members and stock
\item Allow enquiry to determine the whereabouts, and dates of return, of
particular books 
\item Produce an itemized bill for each customer at end of each month.

Write a program to encrypt and decrypt user passwords. 

\subsection*{Task 2.1}

A set of encryption key is given in the data file \texttt{ENCRYPT\_KEY.txt}.
The encryption key will map each alphabet and number according to
the table below.
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{}%
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\texttt{a \textrightarrow{} m} & \texttt{m \textrightarrow{} q} & \texttt{y \textrightarrow{} c}\tabularnewline

\texttt{d \textrightarrow{} f} & \texttt{p \textrightarrow{} n} & \texttt{1 \textrightarrow{} 3}\tabularnewline
\texttt{e \textrightarrow{} g} & \texttt{q \textrightarrow{} i} & \texttt{2 \textrightarrow{} 8}\tabularnewline
\texttt{f \textrightarrow{} k} & \texttt{r \textrightarrow{} u} & \texttt{3 \textrightarrow{} 9}\tabularnewline
\texttt{g \textrightarrow{} b} & \texttt{s \textrightarrow{} o} & \texttt{4 \textrightarrow{} 5}\tabularnewline
\texttt{h \textrightarrow{} p} & \texttt{t \textrightarrow{} x} & \texttt{5 \textrightarrow{} 6}\tabularnewline
\texttt{i \textrightarrow{} j} & \texttt{u \textrightarrow{} z} & \texttt{6 \textrightarrow{} 0}\tabularnewline

\texttt{l \textrightarrow{} r} & \texttt{x \textrightarrow{} d} & \texttt{9 \textrightarrow{} 2}\tabularnewline

\par\end{center}

For example, \texttt{a} is mapped to \texttt{m}, \texttt{b} mapped
to \texttt{h}, m mapped to \texttt{q}, \texttt{9} mapped to \texttt{2},
etc. The mapping is case-sensitive for alphabets. Therefore a password
\texttt{WhizKid123} will be encrypted to \texttt{VpjaEjf389}.

Conversely, decryption works in the opposite way. Hence the password
\texttt{VpjaEjf389} will be decrypted to \texttt{WhizKid123}. 

There is no mapping for symbols. Some examples of symbols are \texttt{!},\texttt{
@}, \texttt{\#}, \texttt{\$}, \texttt{\%}, \texttt{\textasciicircum}.
Hence, a password \texttt{Extr@123} will be encrypted to \texttt{Gdxu@389},
where the symbol remains the same. 

\textbf{\emph{Copy and paste}} the encryption key (from data file
\texttt{ENCRYPT\_KEY.txt})\textbf{\emph{ into your program code}}
and \textbf{\emph{make use of it}} to write a program that 
\begin{itemize}
\item Allows a user to select option to \textbf{\emph{encrypt}} or \textbf{\emph{decrypt}}
a user password
\item Gets user input of the password,
\item Encrypts (or decrypts) the password according to user\textquoteright s

The PJC clinic has several doctors. When a patient wants to book an
appointment with a doctor, the patient rings the doctors' receptionist.
The receptionist asks for the following details:
\begin{itemize}
\item patient name 
\item first line of address
\item doctor requested 
\end{itemize}
The receptionist checks the files to ensure that the patient is registered
with the clinic. The receptionist looks to find the requested doctor's
free appointments in the appointments book. The receptionist offers
the patient a day and a time for the appointment. If this is agreed
then the patient's name is written in the space in the appointment
book for that day and time. 

At the beginning of every day, the receptionist types an appointment
list for each of the doctors for that day. The list contains the appointment
times and patients\textquoteright{} names. When the patient arrives
at the doctors' clinic for their appointment, they give their name
to the receptionist. The receptionist informs each doctor as their
patients arrive.

A linked list of nodes is used to store data for a college. The data
include name of student and exam mark. 

The linked list Abstract Data Type (ADT) has commands to create a
new linked list, add data items to the list and display the list. 

The program to implement this ADT will use the classes \texttt{Node}
and \texttt{LinkedList} as follows: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}

In the \texttt{Node} class, \texttt{name} and \texttt{mark} store
a student\textquoteright s name and exam mark respectively, while
\texttt{nextPtr} is a pointer to the next node. 

In the \texttt{LinkedList} class, \texttt{head} is a pointer to the
first node in the linked list. When the linked list has no data, \texttt{head}
will be set to --1.

Data added to the linked list will be stored in alphabetical order

\textbf{Results management }

For this task, you are required to read the text file \textquotedblleft \textbf{overall\_grades.txt}\textquotedblright{}
which contains the subject grades of the first and second semester
examination of 50 students.

The format of the text file is as follow: \texttt{<name>;<subject1>:<grade1>,<grade2>;<subject2>:<grade1>,<grade
2>;<subject3>:<grade1>,<grade2>,\dots etc;\textbackslash n }

For example: 

\texttt{Rufus Schuck;EL:C,B;CL:C,C;Math:C,E;Bio:B,F; }

Student Rufus Schuck takes 4 subjects. They are English (EL), Chinese
(CL), Math (Math) and Biology (Bio). His 1st and 2nd semester grades

\textbf{Missing phone number digits }

Your friend (Mary) made an oversea friend (Jenny) yesterday while
she was studying in the regional library. To remain in contact, Jenny
gave Marry her phone number and told Mary that it is also a valid
10 digits International Standard Book Number (ISBN). 

After Jenny had left, Mary accidentally punched a few holes on the
phone number while she was arranging her notes using the library\textquoteright s
hole puncher machine. It was too difficult for Mary to recover the
lost pieces of paper. So, Mary decided to look for you to recover
the missing digits instead. Below is the picture of the paper.
\noindent \begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Github/question_bank/LyX/static/img/9597-RHVS-2017-P1-Q1-1}
\par\end{center}

To recover the missing digits, you need to understand how ISBN-10
works. The steps to check for a valid ISBN-10 is as follow: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]  Each of the digits of the ISBN-10 is first multiplied by a number
in a sequence from 10 to 1 (Take note that the last digit of the ISBN-10
can be \textquoteleft X\textquoteright{} which holds a value of 10).
\item[2.]  All the 10 digits are then added up together. 
\item[3.]  If the sum is divisible by 11, it is a valid ISBN-10, else it is
invalid. 
\end{enumerate}
For example, to check if \textquoteleft 997150233X\textquoteright{}
is a valid ISBM-10:

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\emph{Step 1 and 2}

\emph{
\begin{align*}
 & (9\times10)+(9\times9)+(7\times8)+(1\times7)+(5\times6)+(0\times5)+(2\times4)+(3\times3)+(3\times2)+(\boldsymbol{X}\times1)\\
= & (9\times10)+(9\times9)+(7\times8)+(1\times7)+(5\times6)+(0\times5)+(2\times4)+(3\times3)+(3\times2)+(\boldsymbol{10}\times1)\\
= & 297
\end{align*}
}

\emph{Step 3}

\emph{297 is a multiple of 11. Therefore, \textquoteleft 997150233X\textquoteright{}
is a valid ISBN-10. }%
\end{minipage}

\subsection*{Task 2.1}

Write a function \texttt{is\_valid\_ISBN10(isbn10)} which takes a
string \texttt{isbn10} as input and returns \texttt{True} if \texttt{isdn10}
is a valid ISBN-10 and \texttt{False} otherwise. You are to validate
the input string \texttt{isbn10} and print to terminal the issue related
to the \texttt{isbn10} string. The possible issues to be printed to
terminal includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ISBN-10 must only have 10 digits. }
\item \texttt{ISBN-10 can only contain numbers and the character 'X'. }
\item \texttt{'X' can only be found at the last digit of isbn10. }
\item \texttt{Wrong check digit.}

Implement the following \texttt{LinkedList} class functions according
to its specification given: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{+insert\_data(data) : }This function takes a string \texttt{data}
as input and uses its value to create a new \texttt{Node} instance.
The new Node instance is then inserted as the first node of the linked
list\texttt{.}
\item \texttt{+transfer(llist) :} This function takes a \texttt{LinkedList}
instance \texttt{llist} as input and transfers all its \texttt{Node}
instances in the same order to the \texttt{LinkedList} instance that
calls for this function. 

For example: 

\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{A:'boy'->'man'->'woman'}

\texttt{B:'girl'->'baby' }

\texttt{>\textcompwordmark >\textcompwordmark > A.transfer(B) }

\texttt{A: 'boy'->'man'->'woman'->'girl'->'baby'}

\texttt{B: None}%
\end{minipage}
\item \texttt{+delete\_pos(pos) : }This function takes in an integer pos
as input and deletes the node at position pos. Take note that the
first node of the linked list is position 1.

For example: 

\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{A:'boy'->'man'->'woman' }

\texttt{>\textcompwordmark >\textcompwordmark > A. delete\_pos(2) }

to manage the grocery store. 

First, you are tasked to work on an object-oriented solution to store
all the grocery details. The \texttt{title} of the grocery item, \texttt{cost},
\texttt{price} and \texttt{stock} of each grocery is recorded. Besides
the normal groceries, the shop identifies three unique types of grocery
too, namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item Electrical Appliance: there is a need to indicate the \texttt{power}
of the product to understand its energy consumption rate.
\item Cigarette: it is important to track the \texttt{nicotine content}
of various kinds of cigarette.
\item Alcohol: there are distinct \texttt{types} of alcohols such as wine
or beer.

and alcohols: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Cigarette: additional 60\% tax 
\item Wines: additional 50\% tax 
\item Beers: additional 20\% tax 
\end{itemize}
For example: \emph{the price of one packet of \textquotedblleft Yun
Yan\textquotedblright{} cigarette is \$23.00, the final price can
be calculated by: \$23.00 x 160\% x 107\% = \$39.38}

In addition, to support the \textquotedblleft save energy movement\textquotedblright ,
all electrical appliance with a power less than or equals to 10Watt
was set to be sold at 80\% of its original price. 

Implement the function \texttt{calculate\_final\_price()} which includes
the above mentioned tax and promotion into consideration. 

Implement the \texttt{\_\_str\_\_()} function which returns a string
in the following format (You may refer to the \texttt{test\_function\_5\_1()}
to understand the formatting): 

\texttt{Title | Cost | Price | Stock | Final Price }

For example, Yun Yan\textquoteright s cost is \$16.50, price is set
at \$23.00, the current stock is 4 and final price is \$39.38. The

sold. You may assume the title of item is always valid and the quantity
sold is always smaller than the current stock. 

The function should decrease the current stock of the sold items.
Upon completion, it should print out a string containing the following
information:

\texttt{Title | Unit Price | Quantity Sold | Subtotal}

The function should return a float containing the \texttt{sub\_total}
value.
\item \texttt{sell\_items(sold\_item \_list)} \texttt{sold\_item\_list}
is a list of tuples; each tuple containing the item \texttt{title}
and \texttt{quantity} sold. 

The function should print out a table displaying information for all
sold items in the following format: 

\texttt{Title | Unit Price | Quantity Sold | Subtotal}

The summary should end with a line indicating the overall total value
of items sold in this transaction. 
\item \texttt{stock\_check()} When this function is called, it should check
the list of all grocery items and print out a summary of items with
current stock value below 5. This indicates the need for stocking
up these items soon. A summary table should be printed in the following

The Singapore Quick Response Code (SGQR) is a single QR code that
combines multiple e-payment solutions into one. It is intended to
simplify QR e-payments in Singapore for both consumers and merchants.

Currently, consumers see multiple QR codes at merchant stores promoting
various e-payment solutions. This can be confusing for consumers who
have to manually find if their preferred e-payment option is accepted.
Merchants are also impacted by the aesthetic and logistics constraints
of supporting multiple QR codes on their limited display and retail
space. With SGQR, consumers will see a single SGQR label that shows
all QR payment options that the merchant accepts. For merchants, SGQR
will be an infrastructure-light and cheaper way to accept multiple
types of e-payments.

A programmer is writing a treasure island game to be played on the
computer. 

The island is a rectangular grid, 30 squares by 10 squares. Each square
of the island is represented by an element in a 2D array. The top
left square of the island is represented by the array element {[}0,
0{]}.

There are 30 squares across and 10 squares down. 

The computer will: 
\begin{itemize}
\item generate three random locations where treasure will be buried 
\item prompt the player for the location of one square where the player
choose to dig
\item display the contents of the array by outputting for each square: 
\begin{itemize}
\item '.' for only sand in this square
\item 'T' for treasure still hidden in sand 
\item 'X' for a hole dug where treasure was found
\item 'O' for a hole dug where no treasure was found. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Here is an example display after the player has chosen to dig at location
{[}9, 3{]}:

The game is to be implemented using object oriented programming. 

The programmer has designed the class \texttt{IslandClass}. The identifier
table for this class is: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Grid : ARRAY{[}0:9, 0:29{]} OF CHAR} - 2D array to represent
the squares of the island 
\item \texttt{Constructor()} - instantiates an object of class \texttt{IslandClass}
and initialises all squares to sand 
\item \texttt{HideTreasure()} - generates a pair of random numbers used
as the grid location of treasure and marks the square with \texttt{'T'} 
\item \texttt{DigHole(Row, Column)} - takes as parameter a valid grid location
and marks the square with \texttt{'X'} or \texttt{'O'} as appropriate 
\item \texttt{GetSquare(Row, Column) : CHAR} - takes as parameter a valid
grid location and returns the grid value for that square from the
\texttt{IslandClass} object 
\item \texttt{DisplayGrid()} - shows the current grid data. \texttt{DisplayGrid}
should make use of the getter method \texttt{GetSquare} of the \texttt{IslandClass}
class
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Task 1.1 }

The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) is an international bank
account identification standard used in many countries. It uses modulo
arithmetic to perform validation. The IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric
characters, as follows: country code -- two letters check digits
-- two digits, and basic bank account number -- up to 30 alphanumeric
characters that are countryspecific An example of an IBAN in the United
Kingdom Great Britain which is 22 characters is \texttt{GB82WEST12345698765432}
(\texttt{GB} - country code, \texttt{82} - check digits) 

The following is the IBAN check digits generation algorithm: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]  Initialize the two check digits by \texttt{00} (e.g. \texttt{GB}\texttt{\uline{00}}\texttt{WEST12345698765432}).
\item[2.]  Move the four initial characters to the end of the string (e.g.
\texttt{WEST12345698765432GB}\texttt{\uline{00}}). 
\item[3.]  Replace each alphabet in the string with two digits, using the mapping
A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, . . . . . , Z = 35 (i.e. ASCII value of uppercase
letters - 55) (e.g. \texttt{\uline{32142829}}\texttt{12345698765432}\texttt{\uline{1611}}\texttt{00}). 
\item[4.]  Convert the string to an integer. 
\item[5.]  Calculate the remainder of dividing this number by 97 (e.g. \texttt{3214282912345698765432161100
mod 97 = 16}).
\item[6.]  Subtract the remainder from 98 to give the two check digits (e.g.
check digits \texttt{= 98 - 16 = 82}). If the result is a single digit
number, pad it with a leading 0 to make a two-digit number. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Task 2.1 }

Write program code for the \texttt{CheckDigits} function using the
following specification. 
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{FUNCTION CheckDigits (IBAN : STRING) : STRING }
\par\end{center}

An IBAN is validated by converting it into an integer and performing
a basic mod-97 operation on it. If the IBAN is valid, the remainder
equals 1. The algorithm of IBAN validation is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]  Move the four initial characters to the end of the string (For the
IBAN \texttt{GB82WEST12345698765432} e.g. \texttt{WEST12345698765432}\texttt{\uline{GB82}}).
\item[2.]  Replace each letter in the string with two digits, thereby expanding
the string, where A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, . . . . . , Z = 35 

(e.g. \texttt{\uline{32142829}}\texttt{12345698765432}\texttt{\uline{1611}}\texttt{82}). 
\item[3.]  Interpret the string as a decimal integer and compute the remainder
of that number on division by 97 

(e.g. \texttt{3214282912345698765432161182 mod 97 = 1}). 
\end{enumerate}
If the remainder is 1, the check digit test is passed and the IBAN
might be valid.

\subsection*{Task 2.2 }

IBAN is valid. This function should have a parameter which allows

Bowling is a sport in which a \textquoteleft bowler\textquoteright{}
rolls a bowling ball down a synthetic lane and towards ten pins positioned
at the end of the lane. The objective is to score points by knocking
down as many pins as possible.

\par\end{center}

\textbf{A bowling game }

One game of bowling consists of ten frames. Each frame consists of
two chances for the bowler to knock down ten pins.

\textbf{Strikes and spares }

Knocking down all ten pins on the first roll of any frame is called
a \textbf{strike}, denoted by \textquoteleft X\textquoteright{} on
the score sheet. If a bowler takes two rolls to knock down all ten
pins, it is called a \textbf{spare}.

\textbf{Scoring and bonus scoring}

Each pin that is knocked down is worth 1 point. 

A strike is worth 10 points plus the number of pins hit on the next
two rolls.

A spare is worth 10 points plus the number of pins hit on the next
roll.

The total score for a game ranges from 0 to 300 points.

\textbf{The tenth frame }

A bowler who strikes or spares the tenth frame will be given one extra
roll. The number of pins hit on this roll will be added to the bowler\textquoteright s
score.

At the 2018 Singapore Championship, bowlers play a total of six games
each in the qualifying round. The eight bowlers with the highest total
score qualify for the Masters Competition. You may assume that there
are no bowlers with the same total score.

\texttt{SCORES.TXT} is a text file containing the register number,
country and the scores for six games of twenty bowlers in the qualifying
round, with one bowler per line in the format: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{<Register Number> <Country> <Score 1> <Score 2> \dots{} <Score
6>}
\par\end{center}

For example: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{157 MAS XXXXX9091XXX82 90XXXXXXXXXX9 \dots{} 8172XXXX919191XX8}
\par\end{center}

\subsection*{Task 4.3 }

Design and write program code to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Read the entire contents of \texttt{SCORES.TXT}. 
\item Calculate the score of each game for all twenty bowlers, using your
code in \textbf{Evidence 8}. You may assume that all the scores in
\texttt{SCORES.TXT} are valid scores.
\item Calculate the total score for each bowler and store this in an appropriate
data structure together with the respective \texttt{Register Number}
and \texttt{Country}. 
\item Use \textbf{bubble sort} to sort the bowlers according to their total
score. 
\item Output the Official Results of the competition.
\end{itemize}
An example of the output should look like this:

The Singapore Armed Forces is made up of many men and women who are
committed to protect the nation\textquoteright s peace and security.
The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) keeps detailed personnel records
of all servicemen and servicewomen in a large database housed in the
central server at MINDEF Headquarters. Personnel records include career
history, salary, military rank, health details, achievements and awards.

The Human Resource Unit (HR) of MINDEF manages these records regularly
through a computerised system. Updates of the personnel\textquoteright s
records must be done within three working days once HR receives the
information from any military unit in MINDEF. Subsequently, administrative
officers of the military units in MINDEF will be able to view these
records via the intranet.

The current system has been used for the last fifteen years. MINDEF
wishes to replace this system with a new computerised system with
enhanced features and a better user interface. A system developer
is employed to carry out the task. 

MINDEF has accepted the proposal by the system developer, who will
address the following problems with the current system: 

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]  Poor database design 
\item[2.]  Limited types of reports that can be generated 
\item[3.]  Lack of intuitiveness of the user interface
\item[4.]  Slow system response time 
\item[5.]  Incompatibility with the current devices\textquoteright{} operating
systems
\item[6.]  Minimal security protection
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{minipage}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The system developer produces the following Program Evaluation and
Review Technique (PERT) chart:

A. Analysis of the solution 

B. Design of the solution 

C. Development of the solution

D. Documentation of the solution 

E. Implementation of the solution

F. Testing of the solution

Time is measured in weeks. \quad{}

\item The system developer is required to provide more details in the PERT
chart. It is proposed that Activity F should be removed from the chart
and three new activities added:

J. Black box testing -- 2 weeks 

K. White box testing -- 2 weeks

L. Beta testing -- 3 weeks

Redraw the PERT chart to show the effects of these changes. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Draw a sketch of the Gantt chart to show the information in \textbf{(a)}.
\hfill{}{[}6{]}
\item Maintenance will be required after implementing the new system.

Describe two types of maintenance. For each type, give an example
for this new system. \hfill{}{[}6{]}
\item The new system will provide all staff in HR with full access to all
personnel records. The administrative officers of the military unit
will have only read access to the data. Only designated computers
in the MINDEF network are able to access the system.

Describe \textbf{three} ways in which the security of this system
can be maintained. \hfill{}{[}6{]}

to be enrolled in exactly one affiliate club. A relational database
is used by SBF to store data about competition entries and results.
Four tables present in the database are \texttt{CLUB}, \texttt{MEMBER},
\texttt{COMPETITION} and \texttt{COMPETITION-MEMBER}. A new row is
created in the \texttt{COMPETITION-MEMBER} table whenever a competitive
bowler registers for a competition. When the competition results become
available, they are added to the appropriate row.

Rock Paper Scissors is a well-known hand game played between two players,
whom we shall call P1 and P2. For each round, each player simultaneously
forms one of three signs with an outstretched hand. Rock (represented
by \textquotedbl 0\textquotedbl ), scissors (represented by \textquotedbl 2\textquotedbl )
and paper (represented by \textquotedbl 5\textquotedbl ).

Program \texttt{get\_round\_winner(p1\_hand, p2\_hand)} that decides
who wins from the hand signs of P1 and P2. If P1 wins, the function
returns 1. If P2 wins, the function returns 2. If the game is a draw,
the function returns 0.

Sample Execution:

\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{get\_round\_winner (\textquotedbl 2\textquotedbl , \textquotedbl 5\textquotedbl )

P1 and P2 played a game of Rock Paper Scissors over a few rounds.
The winner is the player who wins more rounds than he losses. A draw
occurs if there is no winner. The hand signs of each player for the
game are represented as a string of \textquotedbl 0\textquotedbl ,
\textquotedbl 2\textquotedbl{} and \textquotedbl 5\textquotedbl .
For example, \textquotedbl 205\textquotedbl{} represents playing
scissors in the first round, rock in the second, and paper in the
third. 

Program \texttt{get\_game\_winner(p1\_hands, p2\_hands)} that decides
who wins the game from a sequence of hand signs from P1 and P2. If
P1 wins, return 1, if P2 wins, return 2, if the game is a draw, return
0. You must use \texttt{get\_round\_winner}. You may assume that \texttt{p1\_hands}

J \& J Dental Care has a team of freelance dentists. As there are
two dental treatment rooms in the clinic, only two dentists may be
on duty each day. The clinic manager finalises the monthly duty roster
a week before the new month commences. Every patient has to either
call or visit the clinic to book an appointment. The receptionist
handling the booking will require the following details: 
\begin{itemize}
\item patient name 
\item postal code 
\item dentist requested (optional)
\item date requested 
\end{itemize}
The receptionist checks the hard copy files to ensure that the patient
is registered with the clinic and views the availability in the appointments
book. After the dentist, date and time have been finalised, the patient\textquoteright s
appointment will be recorded in the appointments book.

At the beginning of each day, the receptionist types an appointment
list for each of the dentists working that day. The list contains
patients\textquoteright{} names and their respective timings. 

When patients arrive at the clinic for their appointments, they announce
their names to the receptionist and the receptionist will enter the
treatment rooms to inform the dentists. 

The clinic has decided to replace this manual system with a computerised
system. 

A system developer is employed to carry out the project. The first
task assigned to the system developer is to write a project proposal.
\begin{enumerate}
\item One section of the project proposal is the Problem Statement which
lists the problems in the current system. Write the Problem Statement.

\textbf{Accumulative Season Scores }

For the first task, you are required to read the text file \textquotedblleft \emph{T1\_gamescore.txt}\textquotedblright{}
which contains the accumulative scores of a group of players from
an online game over 12 seasons. 

The format of a line of the text file is as follow: \texttt{<player1\_name>,<class\_1>:<ss1>,<ss2>,<ss3>,<ss4>,<ss5>,<ss6>,<
ss7>,<ss8>,<ss9>,<ss10>,<ss11>,<ss12>\textbackslash n }

E.g.

\texttt{Rufus,priest:4255,17366,22616,31889,49634,58847,78112,86631,94
924,106955,125372,130725 }

The above line represents the player \texttt{Rufus} plays the class
\texttt{priest} and his 12 accumulative seasonal scores are \texttt{4255,
17366, 22616, 31889, 49634, 58847, 78112, 86631, 94924, 106955, 125372}
and \texttt{130725} respectively. 

\subsection*{Task 1.1 -- Read the file }

Implement the procedure readfile. It reads the file \textquotedblleft T1\_gamescore.txt\textquotedblright{}
and returns a list of lists as below. 

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{>\textcompwordmark >\textcompwordmark > results = readfile() }

\subsection*{Task 1.3 -- Top Class by Season }

Using the data from \textquotedblleft \emph{T1\_gamescore.txt}\textquotedblright ,
implement the function \texttt{top\_class\_by\_season}. It takes in
the integer \texttt{season} as parameter and returns a string which
contains the class which holds the highest average score of the season.
(Code with the assumption that you do not know how many and what the
classes are available in this game.) 

The average score of the season of a class is calculated by summing
up all the scores of the players who play the class divided by the
total number of players who play the same class.

\textbf{Health Workshops }

To promote healthy lifestyle, a local company decided to sponsor its
500 employees up to 3 health workshops of their choice. The company
decides to maintain this piece of information using a binary search
tree (BST) with each node contains a string called \texttt{employeeID}
which is used as the key of the BST, and an array structure called
workshops to store the name(s) and cost(s) of the health workshop(s)
chosen by the employee. 

\subsection*{Task 2.1}

Implement the BST structure and perform insertion using the 8-character
employee ID as key. During the insertion process, the employee\textquoteright s
respective health workshop(s) information must also be stored in the
node. The information of the employees and their chosen workshops
can be found in \textquotedblleft \emph{T2\_healthworkshops.txt}\textquotedblright{}
and its format is as follow: 

\texttt{<employeeID>-{[}<workshopName1>,<cost1> {[}<workshopName2>,<cost2>{]} }

For example: 

\texttt{5175590R-{[}Yoga With Yoyo,60{]}{[}Decoding The Nutrition
Label,55{]} }

This means that the employee with \texttt{employeeID} 5175590R has
chosen \textquotedblleft Yoga With Yoyo\textquotedblright{} and \textquotedblleft Decoding
The Nutrition Label\textquotedblright{} workshops and the cost of
these 2 workshops are \$60 and \$55 respectively. 

The BST structure must be able to handle up to 500 nodes. You need
to implement the following functions. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Functions
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{createBST()} This function creates a BST, reads the file \textquotedblleft \emph{T2\_workshops.txt}\textquotedblright ,
perform insertion of data and returns a BST structure. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item \texttt{inOrderTraversal()} This procedure outputs all employee IDs
from the BST in-order. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item \texttt{findWorkshopsById (employeeID)} This function returns a list
of names of all the workshops chosen by the employee with employee
ID as \texttt{employeeID}. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item \texttt{findIdsByWorkshop (workshopName)} This function returns a
list of employee IDs of employees who have chosen the workshop indicated
by the string \texttt{workshopName}. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item \texttt{findTotalCost()} This function returns the cost of all the
workshops chosen by all the employees in the company as an integer.

For this task, if both hands fall into the same category, it is not
necessary to further compare the value. The comparison result will
be deemed as a draw.

\subsection*{Task 4.3 }

Implement the function \texttt{reverse} which simulates a valid move
in the game Reversi.

It takes in 4 parameters as shown below. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{board} -- a 2-Dimension list that represents the current
state of the play board.
\item \texttt{row} -- an integer that represents the row number at which
the disc is placed. 
\item \texttt{col} -- an integer that represents the column number at which
the disc is placed. 
\item \texttt{disc} -- a string that takes either the value of \textquotedbl X\textquotedbl{}
or \textquotedbl O\textquotedbl{} which represents black and white
of the disc. 
\end{itemize}
The function returns \texttt{True} if it is a valid move and then
updates \texttt{board} accordingly, otherwise, returns \texttt{False}
without updating \texttt{board}. 

A valid move refers to, for example, placing a \textquotedblleft \texttt{X}\textquotedblright{}
disc at a position that there exists at least one straight (horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new piece and another
\textquotedblleft \texttt{X}\textquotedblright{} piece, with one or
more contiguous \textquotedblleft \texttt{O}\textquotedblright{} pieces
between them, and vice versa.

Dubbed first of its kind globally, the Singapore Quick Response Code
(SGQR) is an infrastructure-light technology that will help to simplify
QR e-payments in Singapore for both consumers and merchants. 

The SGQR is based on the QR Code Specification for Payment System
- Merchant-Presented Mode standard issued by EMVCo, which has the
benefits of international interoperability, multi-tenancy of QR schemes
and non-sensitive data presented for payments. 

According to the specification, the parsed SGQR text string contains
data items, with each data item adhering to the following structure:
id, length, value. Two such data items are highlighted in bold in
the following diagram: 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Github/question_bank/LyX/static/img/9597-DHS-2019-P1-Q2}
\par\end{center}

Thus for the first data item \texttt{\textbf{000201}}, \texttt{00}
is the id, \texttt{02} is the length, and \texttt{01} is the value. 

And for the last data item \texttt{\textbf{630457B3}}, \texttt{63}
is the id, \texttt{04} is the length, and \texttt{57B3} is the value. 

The value \texttt{57B3} is also a hexdecimal number to verify the
integrity of the SGQR data. 

\subsection*{Task 2.1 }

Write program code to extract the last data item of the SGQR stored
in \texttt{SGQR.TXT}. For the example above, it will be the data item
with id 63 and length 4 i.e. 630457B3.

Each student will submit a list of 6 schools in order of preference.
If two students with the same score are being considered for the last
place in a school, the following tie-breakers will be used: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Citizenship - priority given to Singapore Citizens (SC), then Singapore
Permanent Residents (PR), then International Students (IS) 
\item Choice order of schools - priority given to the student who indicates
a certain school as a higher choice 
\item Computerised balloting

You may assume that in this school all students study subjects at
the standard level. Also, all of them have made up their mind to only
apply to 3 schools of their choice. If a student is unable to get
admission to a school of their choice, they will be posted to SchoolD.

It is decided to process and store the following application information

The Viola-Jones object detection algorithm, named after two computer
vision researchers Paul Viola and Michael Jones, uses integral images
to detect the presence of facial features in an image efficiently. 

An integral image (also known as a summed-area table) is the name
of both a data structure and an algorithm used to obtain this data
structure. It uses a quick and efficient way to calculate the sum
of pixel values in a rectangular part of an image. 

In an integral image, the value of each point is the sum of all pixels
above and to the left, including the target pixel: 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Github/question_bank/LyX/static/img/9597-DHS-2019-P1-Q4-1}
\par\end{center}

The integral image can be calculated in a single pass over the original
image. This reduces summing the pixel intensities within a rectangle
into only three operations with four numbers, regardless of rectangle
size: 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.25\paperwidth]{C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Github/question_bank/LyX/static/img/9597-DHS-2019-P1-Q4-2}
\par\end{center}

The sum of pixels in the rectangle ABCD can be derived from the values
of points A, B, C, and D, using the formula $D-B-C+A$. It is easier
to understand this formula visually:

Note that subtracting both B and C means that the area defined with
A has been subtracted twice, so we need to add it back again. 

Thus $D-B-C+A=113-50-42+20=41$.

Blackjack is a two-player card game whose rules are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The player and then the dealer are each given two cards. 
\item The player can then \textquotedbl hit\textquotedbl , or ask for
arbitrarily many additional cards, so long as their total does not
exceed 21. 
\item The dealer must then hit if their total is 16 or lower, otherwise
pass. 
\item Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum
not exceeding 21 is the winner.
\end{itemize}
For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between
2 and 10 counts as their face value, face cards count as 10, and aces
count as 1. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Express the above blackjack game flow using a program flowchart. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Given perfect knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck, devise

A role playing game (RPG) uses object-oriented programming (OOP) to
store its game characters' data. A character, either a hero or a monster,
has a name, health, magic points and inventory. Each character also
has a \texttt{take\_damage()} and a \texttt{display()} method. 

The game also has a special type of character, a dragon, which also
has additional data \texttt{airSpeed} and \texttt{breathType}.

The manager of a private carpark wants to process the daily data of
people using the carpark. The carpark is open from 8am to 11pm and
the carpark charge is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Before 5pm: \$1.50 per hour or part thereof 
\item After 5pm, \$3.00 per entry regardless of the duration
\end{itemize}
However, if a car enters before 5pm and leaves after 5pm, the charge
involves both rules. For example, if the car stays in the carpark
from 2.45pm to 6.30pm, it is broken down to 2 hours 15 minutes before
5pm and 1 hour 30 minutes after 5pm. Hence the charge will be \$1.50
{*} 3 + \$3.00 = \$7.50. 

Each day the carpark electronic system generates a file\texttt{ CARPARK.txt}.
Each record in the file has the following format:
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{<CARPLATE NUMBER>,<START TIME>,<END TIME>}
\par\end{center}

For example, \texttt{SLX2315A,0940,1415} means that a car with car
plate number SLX2315A entered the carpark at 9.40am and left at 2.15pm.

The examinations department of a school needs to keep long-term records
of the overall examination achievements of its students.

Students at the school have two main choices. Firstly, they can take
a variety of subjects and achieve an Academic Diploma. A diploma gives
them the opportunity to go to university. Secondly they can achieve
a Skills Certificate where they focus on one particular area (such
as IT). This gives them the necessary skills to start a career in
their chosen area.

The examinations department decides to store the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{StudID} is used to uniquely identify a particular student
and is six digits. The first four digits represent the year that the
student started at the school and the last two digits are used to
make the \texttt{StudID} unique e.g. 201804.
\item \texttt{Name} is the name of the student and is at most 30 characters.
\item \texttt{StudType} is the type of student and can have the values \textquoteleft D\textquoteright{}
or \textquoteleft S\textquoteright .
\item \texttt{SkillArea} is text and gives the area that the student acquired
skills in. It can have one of three values: \textquoteleft IT\textquoteright ,
\textquoteleft Business\textquoteright{} or \textquoteleft Accountancy\textquoteright .
\item \texttt{NoOfSub} is the number of subjects studied by those taking
the Diploma. 
\item \texttt{Result} is a single character and is used to indicate the
overall grade awarded. For those students who took the Skills Certificate
the grades could be Distinction (D), Merit (M), Pass (P) or Fail (F).
For those who took the Diploma the grade could be one of the letters
A to F. Grade A to E are passes. Grade F is a fail.
\end{itemize}
The program design for a solution to this problem is to be implemented
with object-oriented programming with the following three classes:
\begin{center}

\par\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{SkillArea} would have the value \textquoteleft Diploma\textquoteright{}
if the student is taking a Diploma. 
\item \texttt{NoOfSub} would have the value 0 for those taking the Skills
Certificate.
\item \texttt{Result} is left blank initially.

be displayed to the user. The user will be allowed to enter the result
for the student. The amended record will be stored back in \texttt{STUDENT.txt}. 

The student ID and result that have been input should be validated.

\texttt{ID} & \texttt{STRING} & The ID of the player. All IDs are unique and have the format \texttt{L999}
where \texttt{L} is any uppercase letter and \texttt{9} is a digit.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Score} & \texttt{INTEGER} & The score of the player.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Ptr} & \texttt{INTEGER} & The pointer to the next node.\tabularnewline

The algebraic expression \texttt{X = 2 {*} A + B} could be held in
a binary tree as:

\includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Github/question_bank/LyX/static/img/9597-HCI-2019-P2-Q7}
\par\end{center}

This tree can then be read using the following algorithm:

process left subtree 

process right subtree 

read root node

This will give \texttt{X 2 A {*} B + =} which is the reverse Polish
form of the expression.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using diagrams to help the explanation, or otherwise, show how a computer
can use a stack to evaluate the expression from its reverse Polish
form. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item The tree in the example could be stored in an array called TREE.

The values in each location in the array are: node value; left pointer;
right pointer. Where no left or right pointer exists the rouge value
-1 is used. Copy and complete the array for the example. (Note that,
since in the example there are only seven nodes, three rows of the
array will be unused.) \hfill{}{[}5{]}

the expression:

JP Medical Centre uses a priority queue to register patients who visit
for medical attention. Upon registration at the medical centre, each
patient will be assigned a priority number according to the urgency
in seeking medical care. The urgent cases receive top priority and
go directly to the front of the queue, whereas the minor cases are
added to the bottom of the queue.

A priority queue is an extension of queue with the following properties.
\begin{itemize}
\item Every element has a priority associated with it. Higher priority has
a larger number. 
\item An element with high priority leaves the queue before an element with
low priority.
\item If two elements have the same priority, they are served according
to their order in the queue, i.e. the earlier element will be served
before the later element (FIFO). 
\end{itemize}
An example of operations on a priority queue is shown below:

\textbf{Initial state of priority queue}

The customer visits the show room and informs the salesperson his/her
furniture selection. After which, the salesperson asks the filing
clerk to locate the relevant paper files that contain all the necessary
details of the chosen item in the file cabinet. The files contain
the following information of a furniture item:
\begin{itemize}

The customer pays for the purchase and the salesperson hands the original
purchase order, and a duplicate copy to the customer and the filing
clerk respectively. At the end of the day, the filing clerk will record
the total sales for the day and proceed to order the furniture from
the supplier by sending them a purchase order of the consolidated
furniture items sold for the day.

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose
behavior is defined by a set of value and a set of operations. 

A linked list ADT has the following operations defined:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[i. ]  \texttt{Create(x)} -- creates an empty linked list \texttt{x}.
\item[ii.]  \texttt{Insert(x,item,i)} -- inserts new value, \texttt{item},
into linked list \texttt{x} so that it is at position \texttt{i} in
the linked list.
\item[iii.]  \texttt{Delete(x,i)} -- deletes the \texttt{item} at position \texttt{i}
in the linked list \texttt{x}.
\item[iv.]  \texttt{Read(x,i)} -- returns the \texttt{item} at position \texttt{i}
in the linked list \texttt{x}.
\item[v.]  \texttt{Length(x)} -- returns the number of items in the linked
list \texttt{x}.
\item[vi.]  \texttt{IsEmptyList(x)} -- returns true if linked list \texttt{x}
is empty.
\end{enumerate}
The linked list is implemented by the use of a collection of nodes
that has \textbf{two} parts: the \textbf{data} and a \textbf{pointer
to the next item} in the linked list. In addition, there is a Start
pointer which points to the first node in the list.

To encrypt a message, a keyword cipher is used. It is a form of monoalphabetic
substitution where a keyword is used as the key. The key is used to
determine the letter matchings of the cipher alphabet to the plain
alphabet. Repeating letters in the key is removed. For instance, if
the key used is \texttt{'SECRET'}, the cipher alphabet generated will
be as follows: 

\begin{tabular}{lcccccccccccccccccccccccccc}
Plain text: & \texttt{A} & \texttt{B} & \texttt{C} & \texttt{D} & \texttt{E} & \texttt{F} & \texttt{G} & \texttt{H} & \texttt{I} & \texttt{J} & \texttt{K} & \texttt{L} & \texttt{M} & \texttt{N} & \texttt{O} & \texttt{P} & \texttt{Q} & \texttt{R} & \texttt{S} & \texttt{T} & \texttt{U} & \texttt{V} & \texttt{W} & \texttt{X} & \texttt{Y} & \texttt{Z}\tabularnewline
Cipher Alphabet: & \texttt{S} & \texttt{E} & \texttt{C} & \texttt{R} & \texttt{T} & \texttt{A} & \texttt{B} & \texttt{D} & \texttt{F} & \texttt{G} & \texttt{H} & \texttt{I} & \texttt{J} & \texttt{K} & \texttt{L} & \texttt{M} & \texttt{N} & \texttt{O} & \texttt{P} & \texttt{Q} & \texttt{U} & \texttt{V} & \texttt{W} & \texttt{X} & \texttt{Y} & \texttt{Z}\tabularnewline
\end{tabular}

After the key\textquoteright s unique letters is used up, the rest
of the ciphertext letters are used in alphabetical order, excluding
those already used in the key. Thus, to encode the word \textquoteleft \texttt{Attack}\textquoteright ,
\textquoteleft \texttt{A}\textquoteright{} is replaced with \texttt{'S'},
\texttt{'t'} is replaced with \texttt{'Q'}, and so on giving the encrypted
word as \texttt{'SQQSCH'}.

Frequency analysis is a common method used by code breakers to break
monoalphabetic substitution ciphers. The first step is to analyse
the coded message and construct a frequency table of all the letters
appearing in the coded message. 

Write a program that reads the content from the file \texttt{INTERCEPT.txt}.
The text in this file contains a coded message. Construct a frequency
table (ignore punctuation marks) as follows using a suitable data
structure: 

\begin{tabular}{lcccccccccccccccccccccccccc}
Ciphertext Letter: & \texttt{A} & \texttt{B} & \texttt{C} & \texttt{D} & \texttt{E} & \texttt{F} & \texttt{G} & \texttt{H} & \texttt{I} & \texttt{J} & \texttt{K} & \texttt{L} & \texttt{M} & \texttt{N} & \texttt{O} & \texttt{P} & \texttt{Q} & \texttt{R} & \texttt{S} & \texttt{T} & \texttt{U} & \texttt{V} & \texttt{W} & \texttt{X} & \texttt{Y} & \texttt{Z}\tabularnewline
Frequency: & \texttt{5} & \texttt{2} & $\cdots$ &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tabularnewline

\textbf{EAN-13 }

EAN-13 (European Article Number) barcode a standard describing a barcode
symbology and numbering system used in global trade to identify a
specific retail product type, in a specific packaging configuration,
from a specific manufacturer. 

EAN check digits are calculated by summing each of the odd position
numbers multiplied by 3 and then by adding the sum of the even position
numbers. 

Numbers are examined going from right to left, so the first odd position
is the last digit in the code. The final digit of the result is subtracted
from 10 to calculate the check digit. 

For example, 

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{EAN(first 12 digits) = }\texttt{\textbf{4}}\texttt{0}\texttt{\textbf{0}}\texttt{6}\texttt{\textbf{3}}\texttt{8}\texttt{\textbf{1}}\texttt{3}\texttt{\textbf{3}}\texttt{3}\texttt{\textbf{9}}\texttt{3 }

\texttt{Even digits ~~~~~~~~~= 4 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 9 ~~~~~~=
20 }

\texttt{Odd digits x 3 ~~~~~~= (0 + 6 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 3) x 3 =
69 }

\texttt{Total ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= 20 + 69 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=
89 }

\texttt{Check digit ~~~~~~~~~= 10 \textendash{} 9 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=
1 }%

\textbf{Begemed }

Begemed is a casual game which is played on ruled grids. The player
is required to swap a gem in one of the four possible directions,
namely \textquotedblleft up\textquotedblright , \textquotedblleft down\textquotedblright ,
\textquotedblleft left\textquotedblright , \textquotedblleft right\textquotedblright ;
after the swap, if a row or a column of 3 or more gems are formed,
it\textquoteright s considered a valid move and the connected gems
will be destroyed. Otherwise, it\textquoteright s considered an invalid
move. Note that diagonal directions are not counted. 

Below are some examples of the game demonstrated in a $5\times5$
grid. The letters \textquotedbl d\textquotedbl , \textquotedbl s\textquotedbl ,
\textquotedbl t\textquotedbl , \textquotedbl r\textquotedbl ,
\textquotedbl e\textquotedbl{} represents Diamond, Sapphire, Topaz,
Ruby, Emerald respectively.

You are tasked to create a text-based interactive \textquotedblleft Begemed\textquotedblright{}
game in the following tasks. 

\subsection*{Task 4.1 }

\hline 
\texttt{board: list} & \texttt{board} is a 2-dimensional \texttt{list} hosting the gems inside
each grid. \tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

Methods and its specification.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Board(n: int) : n} is the size used to define the dimension
of the \texttt{board}. The board should be initialized to a ($n\times n$)
2- dimensional list filled with string \textquotedblleft \_\textquotedblright .
\hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item \texttt{new\_game(new\_board : list): new\_game} takes in a \texttt{list}
named \texttt{new\_board} and assign it to the class attribute \texttt{board}.
The following list is provided in the python template file. 

t\texttt{est\_board = {[} {[}'r', 'r', 'd', 'e', 'd'{]}, {[}'s', 'd',
'r', 'd', 't'{]}, {[}'d', 'd', 'r', 's', 'd'{]}, {[}'e', 'r', 't',
'r', 'r'{]}, {[}'t', 'e', 'e', 's', 'd'{]}{]} }

\emph{This method is just a temporary solution which help you in initial
coding and debugging. In a later task, there will be further instructions
to update its implementation.} \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item \texttt{check\_connection( row: int, col: int): boolean : check\_connection}
takes in the \texttt{row} and \texttt{col} value of a particular gem,
then check if there is a connection of 3 or more gems of the same
type in its horizontal or vertical direction. Return \texttt{True}
if such a connection is found, and \texttt{False} otherwise. \hfill{}{[}8{]}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Evidence 24 }

Program code of class Board and class methods up to \texttt{check\_conection}.
{[}11{]} 

Methods and its specification.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{find\_valid\_moves( row: int, col: int): list} : \texttt{find\_valid\_moves}
takes in the \texttt{row} and \texttt{col} value of a particular gem,
then attempt to swap in the four directions (up, down, left, right).
If there is a new connection of 3 or more gems of the same type formed,
record as a valid movement. 

Return a \texttt{list} containing all valid movements. An empty \texttt{list}
is to be returned if no valid movement is found. 

For example:

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{~~~~0~~~1~~~2~~~3~~~4 }

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+ }

\texttt{0 | r | r | d | e | d | }

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+ }

\texttt{1 | s | d | r | d | t | }

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+ }

\texttt{2 | d | d | r | s | d | }

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+ }

\texttt{3 | e | r | t | r | r | }

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+ }

\texttt{4 | t | e | e | s | d | }

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+ }%
\end{minipage}

If \texttt{find\_valid\_moves(0, 2)} is called, the function should
return \texttt{{[}'d', 'l'{]}} because when down swap or left swap
is performed on gem at \texttt{(0, 2)}, a new connection of 3 or more
gems of the same type will be formed. {[}5{]}
\item \texttt{display(hint: Boolean=False)} : \texttt{display} will print
out the \texttt{board} according to the sample format given. Take
note that the \texttt{size} of the board can be changed and hence
the grid outline should be dynamically adjusted according to its \texttt{size}. 

For example: 

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{~~~~0~~~1~~~2~~~3~~~4}

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+}

\texttt{0 | r | r | d | e | d |}

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+}

\texttt{1 | s | d | r | d | t |}

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+}

\texttt{2 | d | d | r | s | d |}

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+}

\texttt{3 | e | r | t | r | r |}

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+}

\texttt{4 | t | e | e | s | d |}

\texttt{~~+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+-{}-{}-+}%
\end{minipage}

\texttt{hint} is an optional argument with a default value of \texttt{False}.
If \texttt{hint} is set to be \texttt{True}, the gems with valid moves
should be highlighted by using the \textbf{uppercase} letters, and
the valid moves for the \textbf{coordinates} and \textbf{directions}
should be displayed too. 

For example: 

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{(0, 1) {[}'r'{]}}

\texttt{(0, 2) {[}'d', 'l'{]}}

\texttt{(1, 2) {[}'u'{]} }

mode by default should be \texttt{off}. Use this option to toggle
the \texttt{on} and \texttt{off} state of hint mode.

If \texttt{hint} mode is \texttt{on}, the menu interface should automatically
highlight the gems with valid moves and print out a list of the coordinates
together with its valid movement directions. 
\item \texttt{Move the Gem! :} Move a gem in a chosen direction.

A user-defined linked list has the following operations.

Operations and its descriptions 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{create()} : This function creates an empty linked list.

For example: 

\texttt{lst1 = create()}

A linked list is created and referenced by \texttt{lst1}.
\item \texttt{insert(llst,data)} : This procedure always adds \texttt{data}
as a node at the head of the linked list

For example

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{lst1: 'A'->'B'->'C'->'D'->'E'}

\texttt{insert(lst1, 'Z')}

\texttt{lst1: 'Z'->'A'->'B'->'C'->'D'->'E'}%
\end{minipage}
\item \texttt{split(llst,pos)} The function breaks the linked list at position
\texttt{pos} and returns the cut half as a new linked list.

For example: 

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{lst1: 'A'->'B'->'C'->'D'->'E'}

\texttt{lst2 = split(lst1, 2)}

\texttt{lst1: 'A'->'B' }

\texttt{lst2: 'C'->'D'->'E'}%
\end{minipage}
\item \texttt{join(llst1,llist2)} This function joins 2 linked lists as
one.

For example: 

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{lst1: 'C'->'B' }

\texttt{lst2: 'A'->'D'->'E}

\texttt{join(lst1, lst2)}

\texttt{lst1: 'C'->'B'->'A'->'D'->'E' }

\texttt{lst2: Empty}%

Using the provided operations of the linked list, write, in pseudo-code
an algorithm that could be used to implement the \texttt{swap} operation.
\emph{Hint: you don\textquoteright t have to use all the operations
provided}.

Operations and its description 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{swap(llst,pos)} : This procedure swaps the data at positions
\texttt{pos} and \texttt{pos + 1}

For example: 

\noindent %
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\texttt{lst1:'A'->'B'->'C'->'D'->'E' }

\texttt{swap(lst1,3)}

Run length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of lossless data compression
which runs on sequences having same value occurring many consecutive
times and it encodes the sequence to store only a single value and
its count. For example, \textquotedblleft 111111000\textquotedblright{}
can be converted to \textquotedblleft 6130\textquotedblright .

INTEGER A list to store the index of nodes traversed Root INTEGER
Index for the root position of the Tree array NextFreeChild INTEGER

cell. (Neighbouring cells are those adjacent horizontally, vertically
or diagonally.)

If the player selects a cell that is a bomb, it \textquoteleft explodes\textquoteright{}
and he loses the game. The number of cells the player has selected
without exploding a bomb will be the player\textquoteright s score.

You are required to write a program code to generate a minesweeper
grid, randomly position the bombs and populate all the other cells
with the values indicating the number of bombs in the neighbouring
cells. Without revealing the minesweeper grid to the player, the program
should prompt the player to select the cells one by one. His score
will be the number of cells opened before hitting a bomb.

An algorithm to generate a knight\textquoteright s tour needs to keep
track of the squares already visited, so that the knight does not

\subsubsection*{Task 2.2}

Suppose the knight is currently on square square, and a list of squares
already visited by the knight is given in \texttt{lis}.

Write a function \texttt{available(square,lis)} that returns a list
of squares which the knight can visit on its next move from \texttt{square},
and are not currently in \texttt{lis}. These are the squares available
to the knight as it tries to complete the tour.

The output should be given in lexicographic order, that is, with the
column numbers in ascending order, and, among the squares with the
same column number, with the row numbers in ascending order. \hfill{}{[}6{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 2.3}

The knight starts at \texttt{(1,1)}, the bottom left square, of an
$8\mathtt{\times}8$ chessboard.

From each square, the knight moves to the available square from which
it has the smallest number of available squares after that. If there
is a tie, the square which comes first in lexicographic order is chosen.

Write program code to generate the knight\textquoteright s tour as
a list of squares in the order they are visited.

On 14 September 2020, it was reported that GrabCar was fined S\$10,000
for a 4th user data privacy violation. The Personal Data Protection
Commission (PDPC) said the update risked the personal data of 21,541
drivers and passengers, including profile pictures, names and vehicle
plate numbers. 

GrabCar rolled back the app to the previous version within about 40
minutes and took other remedial action, PDPC said. 

On Aug 30, 2019, GrabCar notified the PDPC that profile data of 5,651
GrabHitch drivers was exposed to the risk of unauthorised access by
other GrabHitch drivers for a \textquotedbl short period of time
on the same day\textquotedbl{} through the Grab app. 

Grab's investigations traced the cause of the breach to a deployment
of an update to the app on the same day. The purpose of the update
was to address a potential vulnerability discovered within the Grab
app. 

In PDPC's findings, the application programming interface URL which
allowed GrabHitch drivers to access their data, had contained a \textquotedbl userID\textquotedbl{}
portion that could potentially be manipulated to allow access to other
drivers' data. According to GrabCar, there was no evidence that this
vulnerability was exploited. 

To fix the vulnerability, the update removed the \textquotedbl userID\textquotedbl{}
from the URL, which shortened it to a hard-coded \textquotedbl users/profile\textquotedbl .
However, it failed to take into account the URL-based caching mechanism
in the app, which was configured to refresh every 10 seconds. 

The mechanism served cached content in response to data requests,
so as to reduce the load of direct access to GrabCar's database. 

With the update, all URLs in the Grab app ended with \textquotedbl users/profile\textquotedbl .
Without the \textquotedbl userID\textquotedbl{} in the URL, which
directed data requests to the correct GrabHitch driver's accounts,
the caching mechanism could no longer differentiate between drivers. 

Thus, the mechanism provided the same data to all GrabHitch drivers
for 10 seconds before new data was retrieved from GrabCar's database
and cached for the next 10 seconds. 

PDPC said GrabCar did not put in place \textquotedbl sufficiently
robust processes\textquotedbl{} to manage changes to its IT system
that may put personal data it was processing at risk. 

\textquotedbl This was a particularly grave error given that this
is the second time the (GrabCar) is making a similar mistake, albeit
with respect to a different system,\textquotedbl{} he said.

In a statement in response to Reuters' query, Grab said: \textquotedbl To
prevent a recurrence, we have since introduced more robust processes,
especially pertaining to our IT environment testing, along with updated
governance procedures and an architecture review of our legacy application
and source codes.\textquotedbl{} 

In 2019, GrabCar was ordered to pay a financial penalty of S\$16,000
after it sent out more than 120,000 marketing emails to customers
containing the name and mobile phone number of another customer. 

The PDPC had found that GrabCar \textquotedblleft failed to make reasonable
security arrangements\textquotedblright{} to detect the errors in
their database when sending out the emails.

On 28 June 2020, nearly 10,000 TraceTogether tokens were distributed
to vulnerable seniors. The TraceTogether token supplements the TraceTogether
mobile app by extending contact tracing to groups in the community
who do not have smart phones and those whose phones do not work well
with the TraceTogether app. 

The TraceTogether token is designed to capture proximity data based
on Bluetooth signals. Every five minutes, it scans to detect other
TraceTogether users on the token or the app. The more 'hits' between
two TraceTogether users, the more likely they are in close proximity
for an extended period of time. Proximity can be estimated by the
strength of the Bluetooth signal. The closer users are to one another,
the stronger the signal and vice versa. 

There are only four types of data contained in the token: 
\begin{itemize}
\item user's randomised ID 
\item randomised ID of any other user in proximity 
\item Bluetooth signal measured using RSSI{*} 
\item timestamp of the encounter. 
\end{itemize}
{*}Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is a measure of the power
level at the receiver. A more negative number indicates a device is
further away. For example, a value of -20 to -30 indicates a device
is close while a value of -120 indicates it is near the limit of detection. 

It is important to note that these IDs do not refer to NRIC number,
but randomised and anonymised IDs linked to a personal identifier
like a mobile number. Also, no data is extracted unless a user has
tested positive for COVID-19. From there, MOH has a special software
key that can unlock the device and reveal the data for use in contact
tracing. 

A senior is tested positive for COVID-19 and MOH needs to perform
contact tracing. With the user's permission, data from its TraceTogether
token is retrieved and extracted to the file \texttt{TOKEN.txt} and
has the following structure: 

\texttt{UserRandomisedID, OtherRandomisedID, RSSI, Timestamp} 

Timestamp is in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. 

\subsection*{Task 1.1 }

Prolonged exposure is currently defined as being in close contact
for at least 15 minutes within a single session. For simplicity, you

\item Head pointer, pointing to the first element in the linked list 
\item Tail pointer, pointing to the last element in the linked list

The diagram shows the linked structure after four items have been
added and the unused nodes are linked together.

This superclass has the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Initialise()} method sets up an empty linked list. Should
link all nodes to form the free list. Initialise values for head pointer,
tail pointer and free pointer 
\item \texttt{Add(item)} appends the parameter into its correct \textbf{alphabetical}
order in the linked list. 
\item \texttt{Remove(item)} removes the parameter from the ordered linked
list 
\item \texttt{Display()} displays the data items in the linked list in alphabetical
order 
\item \texttt{PrintStructure()} displays the current state of all pointers
and the array contents in index order 
\item \texttt{IsEmpty()} tests for empty linked list 
\item \texttt{IsFull()} tests for no unused nodes
\end{itemize}
The superclass is used to implement a linear queue. 

The subclass \texttt{Queue} has the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Add(item)} appends the parameter to the queue and overrides
the \texttt{LinkedStructure} add method . 
\item \texttt{Remove()} returns and removes the next item in the queue
\item \texttt{Display()} method should display the queue contents in order
(e.g. the earliest added item first) and should override the \texttt{LinkedStructure}
display method. 
\end{itemize}
Each method updates its appropriate pointers, and produces suitable
errors (or returns different values) to indicate if the actions are
not possible, e.g. if the structure is empty. 

For each of the sub-tasks, add a comment statement, at the beginning
of the code using the hash symbol \textquoteleft \#\textquoteright ,

The library in Jurong Pioneer Primary School uses a hybrid data structure
to keep track of its inventory. Each record in the hash table stores
a simple list \texttt{{[}<Category>, <Binary Search Tree object>{]}}.
Each node in the Binary Search Tree (BST) stores the ISBN number and
title of a book. The nodes in each BST share the same book category
and are sorted, in ascending order, according to their ISBN numbers. 

\subsection*{Task 3.1 }

Write the object-oriented code for the \texttt{BST} and \texttt{BSTNode}
classes described above. \hfill{}{[}10{]}

A checksum is applied to determine the Hash Value for each \texttt{<Category>},
where the ASCII value of each character in the title is multiplied
by its position in the \texttt{<Category>} string (starting from left
to right), and then summed. 

For example, given the category \textquotedblleft classics\textquotedblright ,
the summed value would thus be: $99\times1+108\times2+97\times3+115\times4+115\times5+105\times6+99\times7+115\times8=3884$.

$(3884\mod19)+1=9$

A weighted modulus 19 operation is then applied and 1 is added to
the remainder to determine the final Hash Value.

A binary tree is used to represent this coding system. Each node,
except the root node, contains a letter of the alphabet. The position
of each letter in the tree is determined by its Morse code. Moving
from one node to another down the tree is done by traversing either
a left branch or a right branch. A left branch corresponds to a .
(dot) and a right branch corresponds to a -- (dash).

A doubly linked list allows traversal of nodes in both direction which
is not possible in a singly linked list. For example, a user can go
forward or backwards to play the next or previous song.

The \texttt{node}, will store the following data: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{title (str) }
\item \texttt{prev (node) }
\item \texttt{next (node)} 
\end{itemize}
The class, \texttt{SongPlaylist}, will store the following data: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a doubly linked list of \texttt{node} objects. 
\item \texttt{head} pointer, pointing to the first \texttt{node} in the
doubly linked list. 
\end{itemize}
The class \texttt{SongPlaylist} has the following methods: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{insert(SongPlaylist, title: str)} adds a song title at the
beginning of the list. 
\item \texttt{insertafter(SongPlaylist, searchtitle: str, newtitle: str)}
adds a song title after \texttt{searchtitle}.
\item \texttt{display(SongPlaylist)} outputs out the playlist.

\item Methods
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\_\_init\_\_ : PROCEDURE} - Sets all the node data values
to \textquoteleft empty string\textquoteright . Set pointers to indicate
all nodes are unused and linked. Initialise values for start and nextfree.
\item \texttt{isempty : FUNCTION RETURNS BOOLEAN} - Tests for empty linked

A hash table has 8 spaces to store strings, indexed from 1 to 8 inclusive.

The hash function finds the ASCII number of the first letter of the
string, then counts the number of 1s in its binary representation.
This is the index in which the string will be inserted into the hash
table.

For example, the string \texttt{'Arlington'} will have index 2 because
the ASCII number of '\texttt{A}' is 65, which is \texttt{1000001}
in binary, and there are two \texttt{1}s.

The following strings are to be inserted into the hash table in the
order given.

In a hypothetical scenario, a data security company is helping a client
company manage a database of the client company\textquoteright s customers.
The data security company notices a possible vulnerability in the
database.

Further investigation shows that the vulnerability is obscure and
that none or few of the programmers anticipated it. Since the vulnerability
is obscure, they determine that the chances of the database being
breached are minimal, and decide not to tell the client company about
it. 

Instead, the data security company waits until the next time the database
is due for scheduled maintenance to attempt to fix the vulnerability.
By doing so, they can give themselves enough time to learn how to
fix the vulnerability and avoid causing unnecessary panic within the
client company or among the customers, which could lead to a potential
loss of business.

\noindent The Universal Product Code (UPC) system is used for tracking
trade items in shipping, inventory, and sales. Each item is given
a 12-digit identification number. The validity of this identification
number can be checked using a checksum. If $x_{i}$ represents the
$i$th digit (starting with $i=1$ as the leftmost digit), then a
valid identification number satisfies the condition that

\noindent 
\[
3x_{1}+x_{2}+3x_{3}+x_{4}+3x_{5}+x_{6}+3x_{7}+x_{8}+3x_{9}+x_{10}+3x_{11}+x_{12}
\]

\noindent has a remainder of 0 when divided by 10.

\noindent The identification number can be encoded into a barcode.
For this Task, the barcode will be represented as a string of '\texttt{0}'s
and '\texttt{1}'s, where '\texttt{0}' represents a white stripe and
'\texttt{1}' represents a black stripe.

\noindent The barcode is divided into seven sections. From left to
right, they are
\begin{itemize}
\item A \textquoteleft quiet zone\textquoteright{} consisting of nine '\texttt{0}'s; 
\item A start pattern which is always '\texttt{101}'; 
\item The first six digits of the identification number are encoded using
the table below; 
\item A middle pattern which is always '\texttt{01010}'; 
\item The last six digits of the identification number are encoded using
the table below; 
\item An end pattern which is always '\texttt{101}'; 
\item A \textquoteleft quiet zone\textquoteright{} consisting of nine '\texttt{0}'s.
\end{itemize}
\noindent The table below shows the encoding system for the digits.
Note that depending on whether the digit occurs in the first six digits
or the last six digits, it would be encoded differently. However,
the two encodings are optical inverses of each other -- a '\texttt{0}'
is changed into a '\texttt{1}', and vice versa.
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

\noindent The reason for encoding the first and last six digits differently
is that the barcode may inadvertently be scanned upside down. Notice
that in the first six digits, the encoding for each digit contains
an odd number of '\texttt{1}'s, while in the last six digits, the
encoding for each digit contains an even number of '\texttt{1}'s.
This allows the scanning software to detect if the barcode has been
placed upside down and correct it. \quad{} 

\noindent For example, the UPC identification number 036000 291452
would be encoded as:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

\noindent A file compression algorithm reduces file sizes so that
files can be sent more quickly. One such algorithm is the Huffman
algorithm for text files, which will be implemented in this task.

\noindent Unlike ASCII, which assigns a fixed size of 8 bits for each
character, the Huffman algorithm assigns fewer bits to more common
characters and more bits to less common characters. For example, in
a long text written in English, characters such as '\texttt{e}' and
'\texttt{t}' will have fewer bits assigned to them than characters
such as '\texttt{q}' and '\texttt{z}'. If the text is long enough,
this will use fewer bits in total to encode the text compared to ASCII.

\noindent To know which sequence of bits to encode for each character,
the \textbf{frequency} of each character, which is the number of times
each character appears in the text file, is tabulated.

\noindent The characters are put into a tree. A node is created for
each character. The following steps are then repeated until there
is only one node without a parent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the two nodes, without parents, which have the lowest frequency. 
\item Create a new node whose left and right children are the two nodes
identified in Step 1. The frequency of the new node is the total of
the frequency of its children.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent The diagram on the following page shows the process of creation
of a tree for a file with only five distinct characters ('\texttt{A}',
'\texttt{E}', '\texttt{I}', '\texttt{O}' and '\texttt{U}'), in five
stages.

\noindent The bit sequence assigned to a character will be the path
from the root to the node corresponding to that character, where going
left corresponds to '\texttt{0}' and going right corresponds to '\texttt{1}'.
For example, '\texttt{A}' is encoded as '\texttt{10}' and '\texttt{O}'
is encoded as '\texttt{011}'.

\subsection*{Task 2.1}

\noindent Create a Node class that has the following attributes: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{data}, which is determined when the node is initialized 
\item \texttt{left}, a pointer to another node,

\textbf{Task 1}

For this task, submit all code as \texttt{T1\_<index number>\_<name>.py}. 

The Taliban\textquoteright s takeover of Afghanistan had seen the
United States (US) evacuating people. The Republic of Singapore Air
Force offers its A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport plane (A330 MRTT)
to help the US airlift groups of evacuees from Afghanistan. 

\subsubsection*{Task 1.1 }

To prevent Taliban interference, messages sent between evacuees and
the A330 MRTT are encrypted. 

The encryption converts each character of the message into its ASCII
number representation, adds the ASCII number representation of a character
of a secret key which is in the same position, and then converts it
back into ASCII text. 

Secret keys are generated from passwords known only by the sender
and receiver. Passwords that are shorter in length than the message
are lengthened to match by repeating the password until the same length
as the message is achieved. 

For example, given that the inputs are 

\texttt{password : \textquotedbl cat\textquotedbl{} }

\texttt{message ~: \textquotedbl hello\textquotedbl} 

Step 1 - Extend password by repeating until matches length of message 

\texttt{\textquotedbl cat\textquotedbl{} -> \textquotedbl catca\textquotedbl{} }

Step 2 - Convert each character of password and message into ASCII
number representation 

\texttt{\textquotedbl hello\textquotedbl{} -> 104, 101, 108, 108,
111 }

\texttt{\textquotedbl catca\textquotedbl{} -> 99, 97, 116, 99, 97 }

Step 3 - Add the ASCII number representation of same positions together 

\texttt{104+99, 101+97, 108+116, 108+99, 111+97 -> 203, 198, 224,
207, 208 }

Step 4 - Convert each number to its ASCII character 

\texttt{203, 198, 224, 207, 208 -> \textquotedbl \textquotedbl{} }

Therefore, the results are 

\texttt{Secret key : \textquotedbl catca\textquotedbl{} }

\texttt{Encrypted message : \textquotedbl \textquotedbl{} }

Write a function \texttt{generateKey(password, message)} that takes
in two argument strings \texttt{message} and \texttt{password} and
returns the secret key. 

Test your function using \texttt{generateKey(\textquotedbl cat\textquotedbl ,
\textquotedbl hello\textquotedbl )} and show your output. \hfill{}{[}4{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.2 }

Write functions \texttt{encrypt(password, message)} and \texttt{decrypt(password,
message)} that takes in \texttt{password} and message strings and
returns the encrypted or decrypted \texttt{message}. It should use
the above function \texttt{generateKey(password, message)} to obtain
the secret key before performing the encryption. 

Test your function with \texttt{decrypt(\textquotedbl cat\textquotedbl ,
encrypt(\textquotedbl cat\textquotedbl ,\textquotedbl hello\textquotedbl ))}.
Show your output. \hfill{}{[}6{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.3 }

Since the A330 MRTT plane can only take a maximum of 266 passengers
at once, implement a \texttt{Queue} to manage incoming pickup requests
and dropoffs. Write a class Queue with the following methods: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{enqueue(string)} which takes in a string and adds it to the
queue or returns \texttt{\textquotedbl Queue is full!\textquotedbl}
if queue is full 
\item \texttt{dequeue} which removes the next item for the queue or returns
\texttt{\textquotedbl Queue is empty!\textquotedbl} if the queue
is empty 
\item \texttt{display} which returns a string of queue items in sequence
from head to tail or returns \texttt{\textquotedbl Queue is empty!\textquotedbl}
if the queue is empty
\item \texttt{current\_size} which returns an integer of the number of items
in the queue. \hfill{}{[}8{]}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.4 }

Using socket programming, write the client program for the evacuee
teams (client) in Afghanistan and the A330 MRTT plane (server) to
communicate. The program should 
\begin{itemize}
\item use the above queue data structure to manage the requests 
\item request the user to set a password for encryption at the start of
the program 
\item present the user with incoming pickup requests and pickup details
(Team name and group size) as well as queue details (size of current
queue) 
\item allow the user(server) to accept/reject pickup requests 
\item encrypt all information sent and received using \texttt{encrypt(password,
message)} and \texttt{decrypt(password, message)} functions. 
\end{itemize}
You are provided with the client program in \texttt{client.py}. Write
and submit the server program as \texttt{T1\_<index number>\_<name>.py}. 

Study the following sample program output to determine your code design,
output format and socket protocol. User inputs are underlined.

\textbf{Task 2} 

Name your Jupyter Notebook and save all parts for this task as 

\texttt{TASK2\_<index\_number>\_<name>.ipynb }

You will be writing a Math game program for Form Teachers to play
with students in school. The game auto-generates math expressions
and tracks scoring. 

\subsubsection*{Task 2.1 }

Using a stack data structure, write a function \texttt{solver(expr)}
that takes in a string of a mathematical expression expr such as \texttt{\textquotedbl ((1{*}7)+6)\textquotedbl}
and returns \texttt{13}. You may assume that the entire expression
would never have spaces, and would always be enclosed in an opening
and closing parenthesis \textquotedbl ( )\textquotedbl . Do not
use the built-in function \texttt{eval()}. Test your function with
\texttt{solver(\textquotedbl ((1{*}7)+6)\textquotedbl )} and show
your output. \hfill{}{[}6{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 2.2 }

Write a function \texttt{generate\_expression} that takes in an integer
\texttt{operator\_count} and returns a string of a mathematical expression
which has the specified number of operators (i.e. \texttt{+ - {*}
/} ) in \texttt{operator\_count}. The function should use \textbf{recursion}
to form up the operators and operands. The operands, operators and
positions of operands and operators should be random. 

For example, \texttt{generate\_expression(5)} would output \textquotedbl\texttt{(4{*}(6-(2+((1{*}7)+6))))}\textquotedbl{}
and \texttt{generate\_expression(5}) would output \textquotedbl\texttt{((8+(6+((2{*}4)-3)))+6)}\textquotedbl . 

Test your function with \texttt{generate\_expression(5)} and show
your output. \hfill{}{[}7{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 2.3 }

Implement the following using object-oriented programming: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Person}, a class, which 
\begin{itemize}
\item initialises with these attributes 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{name: string }
\item \texttt{gender: string} where male is \textquotedbl\texttt{M}\textquotedbl{}
and female is \textquotedbl\texttt{F}\textquotedbl{} 
\item \texttt{score: integer }
\end{itemize}
\item has the following methods 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{display\_info()} which displays the \texttt{Person}\textquoteright s
\texttt{name}, \texttt{gende}r and \texttt{score} 
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. eg \textquotedbl\texttt{Nelson(M)\textquoteright s score is 3.}\textquotedbl{} 
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{attempts()} which
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. uses the function \texttt{generate\_expression} from Task 2.2 to
generate and display a random math expression of 2 operators 
\item 2. queries the user to give an answer rounded up to the nearest integer 
\item 3. displays \textquotedbl\texttt{Good job!}\textquotedbl{} if the
input is correct or \textquotedbl\texttt{Wrong answer. (Correct
answer: <answer>)}\textquotedbl{} where \texttt{<answer>} is the correct
answer. 
\item 4. increases the score of the student by \texttt{1} if the answer
is correct 
\item 5. displays the user\textquoteright s latest \texttt{sc}ore 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{Student}, a subclass of \texttt{Person}, which 
\begin{itemize}
\item also has the following attribute 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{role: string} which is \textquotedbl\texttt{no role}\textquotedbl{}
by default unless the \texttt{Student} has a class committee role
such as \textquotedbl\texttt{chairperson}\textquotedbl{} 
\end{itemize}
\item also has the following methods 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{student\_role()} which returns a string describing the \texttt{role}
of the \texttt{Student}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{FormTeacher}, a subclass of \texttt{Person}, which 
\begin{itemize}
\item also has the following methods
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{display\_info()} which uses polymorphism to display the\texttt{
FormTeacher}\textquoteright s information with salutation to the FormTeacher\textquoteright s
name 
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. eg: \textquotedbl\texttt{Ms. Norah's score is 0}.\textquotedbl{}
where \textquotedbl\texttt{Norah}\textquotedbl{} is her name, and
\textquotedbl\texttt{Ms}.\textquotedbl{} corresponds to her gender.

\subsubsection*{Task 2.4}

Write driver code to test the earlier class you created. Also, create
\texttt{groups} which is a list that uses a 2-dimensional array to
store and associate each instance created below with his/her civics
group. Use this 2-dimensional array to display the scores of all persons
in each civics group indicating the student chairperson\textquoteright s
name (if any). Test your code with the following steps in order: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Create an instance of \texttt{Student} with \texttt{name} \textquotedbl\texttt{Melvin}\textquotedbl{}
in civics group \texttt{5C35} 
\item Create an instance of \texttt{Student} with \texttt{name} \textquotedbl\texttt{Susan}\textquotedbl{}
in civics group \texttt{5C35} whose role is \textquotedbl\texttt{chairperson}\textquotedbl{} 
\item Create an instance information of \texttt{FormTeacher} with \texttt{name}

\textbf{Task 3} 

In 2021, Singapore's Health Science Authority (HSA) recalled 18 brands
of hand sanitisers due to high levels of acetaldehyde and/or methanol.
The HSA keeps information on current hand sanitisers and uses it to
monitor the types of chemical ingredients used to make the sanitisers. 

\subsubsection*{Task 3.1 }

The task is to implement a priority queue using Object-Oriented Programming. 

A priority queue is an extension of queue with the following properties. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Every element has a priority associated with it. Smaller integer value
has a higher priority. 
\item An element with high priority leaves the queue before an element with
low priority.
\item If two elements have the same priority, they are served according
to their order in the queue, i.e. the earlier element will be served
before the later element (FIFO). 
\end{itemize}

priority numbers. The patient with the highest priority is treated
first, regardless of the order of arrival.

Name your Jupyter Notebook as 

\texttt{TASK4\_<your name>\_<centre number>\_<index number>.ipynb }

The task is to write program code for a Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek game for
two players. 

Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek is a game played on a 4 x 4 square board. The board
starts empty, except that a single 'T' symbol may appear in one of
the 16 squares. There are two players: X and O. They take turns to
make moves, with X starting. In each move a player puts her symbol
in one of the empty squares. Player X's symbol is \texttt{'X'}, and
player O's symbol is \texttt{'O'}. 

After a player's move, if there is a row, column or a diagonal containing
4 of that player's symbols, or containing 3 of her symbols and the
\texttt{'T'} symbol, she wins and the game ends. Otherwise the game
continues with the other player's move. If all of the fields are filled
with symbols and nobody won, the game ends in a draw. 

Given the 4 x 4 board description containing \texttt{'X'}, \texttt{'O'},
\texttt{'T'} and \texttt{'.'} characters (where \texttt{'.'} represents
an empty square). The following examples show the various winning
positions.

JP Fitness Club is a gym that keeps details of its members. You are
tasked to help the club manage the members\textquoteright{} details
and store them in a SQL database. 

There are two types of membership: normal and annual. Each member
has a unique membership number, first name, surname, contact number
and last visit date recorded. 

A normal member deposits a selected amount into their account. Each
time the member visits the gym, the entrance fee is deducted from
the amount held in his account. The member may top up the account
any time. 

An annual member pays a fixed fee per year, starting from the date
of registration. He may then visit the gym any number of times for
the whole year without paying the entrance fee. 

Three classes have been identified: \texttt{Member}, \texttt{NormalMember},
\texttt{AnnualMember}. 

The class \texttt{Member} has these attributes and methods defined
on it. 

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Data type} & \textbf{Description}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{memberID} & String  & 8 digit membership number. First four digits represent the year of
joining gym and last four digits are used to make the \texttt{memberID}
unique, e.g. \texttt{20210357}. \tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{first\_name } & String  & First name of member, at most 15 characters.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{surname } & String  & Surname of member, at most 15 characters.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{contact\_number } & String  & 8 digit contact number.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{last\_visit } & String  & The date when member last visited the gym, in the format\texttt{ YYYY-MM-DD}.
Initialises to today\textquoteright s date. \tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{memberType} & String  & Indicates type of membership, either \textquotedblleft normal\textquotedblright{}
or \textquotedblleft annual\textquotedblright . Initialises to None. \tabularnewline
\hline 
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Return type} & \textbf{Description}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{showMember() } & None  & Outputs member\textquoteright s membership number, first name, surname,
contact number and last visit date.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{isActive() } & Boolean  & Indicates whether a member is active or not. Returns True if the last
visit date is within 30 days, otherwise returns False.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}

The class \texttt{NormalMember} inherits from \texttt{Member} and
has these additional attributes and methods defined on it. 

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Data type} & \textbf{Description}\tabularnewline

The class \texttt{AnnualMember} also inherits from \texttt{Member}
and has these additional attributes and methods defined on it. 

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

The task is to write a function that takes a sequence of characters
representing a colour, and translates the colour into a different
number base. 

8-bit colours are represented with three numbers, indicating the level
of the colours red (R), green (G), and blue (B) respectively. Each
number is an integer from 0 to 255. 255 represents the fully saturated
colour, while 0 represents zero saturation (black).

In HTML, these colours may be represented using hex code as well.
In hex code, the R, G, and B values are converted to hexadecimal.
Hex codes begin with the symbol \textquoteleft \#\textquoteright{}
followed by the three R, G, and B hexadecimal values. 

For example, the hex code \#0A0B0C represents a colour with RGB values
10, 11, and 12 respectively. 

For each of the sub-tasks, add a comment statement, at the beginning
of the code using the hash symbol \textquoteleft \#\textquoteright ,
to indicate the sub-task the program code belongs to, for example: 
\noindent \begin{center}

\subsubsection*{Task 3.1 }

Write a function called \texttt{task3\_1(hex)} that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item takes \texttt{hex}, a string representing a hex code, beginning with
a \textquoteleft \#\textquoteright{} symbol followed by three valid
hexadecimal values between 00 and FF 
\item returns and displays either: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a 3-integer tuple representing RGB values 

or 
\item the error message, \textquotedbl\texttt{invalid data}\textquotedbl{}
\hfill{}{[}5{]}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Test the function fully with suitable test data. 

For example, 

\texttt{task3\_1(\textquotedbl\#FFFFFF\textquotedbl ) }

should return and display \texttt{(255, 255, 255)}\hfill{} {[}3{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 3.2 }

Some image programs do not represent colours using 8-bit integers.
Instead, they represent them as a normalised float value. In this
representation, a value of 1.0 represents the fully saturated colour
and a value of 0 represents zero saturation (black). 

Write a second function \texttt{task3\_2(rgb)} that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item takes a 3-integer tuple rgb representing RGB values 
\item returns and displays either: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a 3-float tuple representing normalised RGB 

or 
\item the error message, \textquotedbl invalid data\textquotedbl{} \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Test the function fully with suitable test data. 

For example, 

\texttt{task3\_2((128, 128, 128))} 

should return and display\texttt{ (0.50196, 0.50196, 0.50196) }

\texttt{task3\_2((255, 255, 255)) }

should return and display\texttt{ (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)}\hfill{} {[}3{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 3.3 }

Image filters are functions that take in image data and change the
RGB values of its colours according to an algorithm. The algorithm
for converting an image to grayscale calculates the average of the
RGB values and sets the R, G, and B values to this average. 

Write a third function \texttt{task3\_3(hex)} that:
\begin{itemize}
\item takes hex, a string representing a hex code 
\item returns and displays a 3-float tuple representing normalised RGB of
the colour converted to grayscale \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\end{itemize}
Test the function fully with \textbf{two} suitable values.

For example, 

\texttt{task3\_3(\textquotedbl\#FF8000\textquotedbl ) }

should return and display \texttt{(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)}\hfill{} {[}2{]}

The implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) using three 1D arrays
is shown below. 

Each unused node that are not in the logical BST is initially connected
in a singly linked list manner using the \texttt{leftPtr} array. The
first position of this linked list is indicated by the variable \texttt{nextFree}. 

When a piece of data is inserted into the BST, a node will be disconnected
from the linked list and added to the logical BST. The root of this
logical BST is indicated by the variable \texttt{root}. The logical
structure of the BST is managed by \texttt{leftPtr} and \texttt{rightPtr}
which are the positions of the left and right child of the node respectively. 

Below is an illustration for such BST with a 0-based index array.

\item The attribute count is the number of nodes that lruq currently have.

Complete the least recently used queue class \texttt{LRUQ} by implementing
the \texttt{use} function. The class function \texttt{use(value)}
takes an integer \texttt{value} as input. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If \texttt{value} is in \texttt{lruq} (referenced by hashmap), it
removes the node in the \texttt{lruq} and re-insert it to the end
of the \texttt{lruq}. 
\item If \texttt{value} is not in \texttt{lruq} (not referenced by hashmap),
it references \texttt{value} in hashmap and inserts a new \texttt{Node}
instance with value as its data to the end of \texttt{lruq}. If \texttt{count}
> \texttt{size}, it removes the least recently used node in \texttt{lruq}
and de-references it in \texttt{hashmap}. 

Hint: To de-reference a key in \texttt{hashmap}, you can call the
following. \texttt{self.hashmap.pop(key, None)} where \texttt{self.hashmap}
is a dictionary object.

\textbf{Car Loaning System }

CaRent is a company providing electronic car rental services. The
company engages you to design a web application using Flask microframework
to aid in the car rental process. 

The following information of each Customer is stored: 

\texttt{CustomerID} -- auto increment integer value to keep track
of the ID of customer. 

\texttt{Name} -- name of customer. 

\texttt{Gender} -- gender of customer, to be stored as a single character,
using either '\texttt{M}' or '\texttt{F}'. 

\texttt{Contact} -- contact number of customer. 

The following information of each Car is stored: 

\texttt{VIN} -- vehicle identification number (VIN) of the car. 

\texttt{Brand} -- brand of the car. 

\texttt{Vehicle Type} -- type of the car, can be \texttt{'Sedan'},
\texttt{'Hatchback'}, \texttt{'SUV'} or \texttt{'MPV'}. 

\texttt{Energy Source} -- type of energy source the engine is running
on, can be \texttt{'Diesel'}, \texttt{'Gasoline'}, \texttt{'Hybrid'}
or \texttt{'Electricity'}. 

\texttt{DailyPrice} -- daily price for renting the car. 

\texttt{Availability} -- availability of the car, can be \texttt{'Available'}
or \texttt{'Unavailable'}. 

The following information of each RentalPoint is stored: 

\texttt{PointID} -- auto increment integer value to keep track of
the ID of rental service point.

\texttt{Address} -- address of the rental point. 

\texttt{OpWeekDay} -- weekdays that the rental point is open, stored
as a 7-digits string, starting from Sunday to Saturday, with \texttt{'1'}
indicating open and \texttt{'0'} indicating closed. E.g. \texttt{'0111110'}
means it is open on weekdays and closed on weekend. 

\texttt{OpStartHr} -- starting time of daily operation, stored as
a 4 digits string, using 24hour time format. 

\texttt{OpEndHr} -- ending time of daily operation, stored as a 4
digits string, using 24hour time format. 

The following information of each \texttt{RentalRecord} is stored: 

\texttt{CustomerID} -- ID of customer. 

\texttt{VIN} -- VIN of car. 

\texttt{StartDate} -- start date for the rental service. 

\texttt{CollectionPointID} -- ID of the collection point. 

\texttt{ReturnDate} -- return date for the rental service. 

\texttt{ReturnPointID} -- ID of the return point. 

The information is to be stored in four tables: 

\texttt{Customer} 

\texttt{Car} 

\texttt{RentalPoint} 

\texttt{RentalRecord} 

\subsubsection*{Task 4.1 }

Create an SQL file called \texttt{Task4\_1.sql} to show the SQL code
to create the database \texttt{car\_rental.db} with the three tables. 

The table \texttt{Customer} must use \texttt{CustomerID} as its primary
key, the table \texttt{Car} must use \texttt{VIN} as its primary key,
and the table \texttt{RentalPoint} must use \texttt{PointID} as its
primary key. 

The table \texttt{RentalRecord} should use \texttt{CustomerID}, \texttt{VIN}
and \texttt{StartDate} as a composite key, while \texttt{CustomerID},
\texttt{VIN} and \texttt{CollectionPointID/ReturnPointID} must refer
to \texttt{CustomerID} in \texttt{Customer}, \texttt{VIN} in \texttt{Car}
and \texttt{PointID} in \texttt{RentalPoint} as foreign keys.

\subsubsection*{Task 4.2 }

The files \texttt{customers.csv}, \texttt{cars.csv}, \texttt{rental\_points.csv}
and \texttt{rental\_records.csv} contains information about the customers,
cars, rental points and the past rental records. The first row of
each file contains the header of the respective columns. Each row
in the files is a comma- separated list of information. 

Write a Python program to insert all information from the three files
into the \texttt{database car\_rental.db}. Run the program. 

Save your program code as \texttt{Task4\_2.py} \hfill{}{[}6{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 4.3 }

\subsubsection*{Task 4.4 }

The company wants to implement a function to register new cars for
rental into the database. Office staff can register new cars by adding
the values of the attributes in the \texttt{Car} table. 

Write a Python program and the necessary files to create a web application
that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Receive the following information: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{VIN}, \texttt{Brand}, \texttt{VehicleType}, \texttt{EnergySource},
and \texttt{DailyPrice} of a car through a HTML form.
\item \texttt{Availability} should be set to the default value of \texttt{'Available'}. 
\item Note that \texttt{VehicleType} and \texttt{EnergySource} should be
in \textbf{dropdown} list format to improve data validity. 
\end{itemize}
\item Check if the \texttt{VIN} is valid based on the following algorithm: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1: Translate all letters to integer values using the following
table (\texttt{I}, \texttt{O}, and \texttt{Q} are not allowed in a
valid \texttt{VIN}): 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{A}: 1  & \textbf{B}: 2  & \textbf{C}: 3  & \textbf{D}: 4  & \textbf{E}: 5  & \textbf{F}: 6  & \textbf{G}: 7  & \textbf{H}: 8  & \textbf{N/A}\tabularnewline

\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}
\item Step 2: Use the following weight factor for each position in the VIN.
\textbf{The 9th position is that of the check digit}. Its weight factor
has been substituted with a \texttt{0}, which will cancel it out in
the multiplication step. 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

\textbf{Position } & \textbf{1 } & \textbf{2 } & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} & \textbf{5} & \textbf{6} & \textbf{7} & \textbf{8} & \textbf{9} & \textbf{10} & \textbf{11} & \textbf{12} & \textbf{13} & \textbf{14} & \textbf{15} & \textbf{16} & \textbf{17}\tabularnewline
\hline 
Weight  & 8  & 7  & 6  & 5  & 4  & 3  & 2  & 10  & 0  & 9  & 8  & 7  & 6  & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}
\item The sum of product of the letter/digit with their corresponding weight
factor is then divided by \texttt{11}. 
\item The remainder is the check digit. If the remainder is \texttt{10},
the check digit will use \texttt{X} instead. 
\item E.g. the \texttt{VIN} with values 1\texttt{M8GDM9A\_KP042788} will
produce a check digit of \texttt{X} and hence \texttt{1M8GDM9AXKP042788}
is a valid \texttt{VIN}. 
\end{itemize}
\item If \texttt{VIN} is valid, create a new car record in the \texttt{Car}
table, and display the record in the confirmation page. 
\item Otherwise, inform the user that the VIN is invalid. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\paperwidth]{C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Github/question_bank/LyX/static/img/9569-RVHS-2021-P2-Q4}

You may assume: 
\begin{itemize}
\item All inputs are in valid format. 
\item VIN: 1M8GDM9AXKP042788 is a new record to the database 
\end{itemize}

A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) abstract data type (ADT) in
which all the elements are inserted and removed from one end. 

It is common to either use a linked list or an array to implement
a stack
\begin{itemize}
\item In the linked list implementation, a root pointer points to the top
of a stack and a data structure. The data structure contains the value
of the data and a pointer pointing to the next node in the stack. 
\item In the array implementation, a fixed size array is used to store the
elements. 
\end{itemize}
The basic stack operations of \texttt{push()}, \texttt{pop()} and
\texttt{peek()} are provided in both implementations. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{push()} is used to insert an element into the stack. 
\item \texttt{pop()} removes an element from the stack and returns the value
of the element. 
\item \texttt{peek()} returns the value of the element at the top of the
stack without removing it.

The Food Services Industry Digital Plan (IDP) was recently launched
by the Minister of State for Trade and Industry to help F\&B businesses
adopt more digital technologies in their daily operations. The manager
of a Iocal restaurant engaged a consultant to propose a digital solution
for his restaurant operations. 

After conducting a comprehensive study, the consultant proposed a
web-based solution using a client-server model. The solution requires
the following hardware to access the web server wirelessly in the
local area network (LAN): 
\begin{itemize}
\item A tablet device on each table for customers to browse the menu and
order their food items. 
\item Multiple large monitors for the chefs in the kitchen to read the ordered
food items. 
\item A computer station for the service staff to check the table number
before serving the food to the customers. 
\item A computer in the manager\textquoteright s office to update the menu
in the web server and print the daily sales report. 
\end{itemize}
When a customer decides to pay the bill, a QR code will be generated
on the tablet device for him to scan and make online payment using
his personal mobile device.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain the meaning of the term client-server model. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item Describe the main software components to be developed for the web
server to host this service for the restaurant. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Describe how the customer would use the client tablet device to browse
and order the food items. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Suggest \textbf{one} feature on the digital form that will provide
a positive experience for the customers when using the tablet device
to order their food. Describe the usability principle applied in this
feature. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item The manager recommends the proposed solution to the shareholders,
but a number of social issues associated with the solution have been
raised. Describe \textbf{two} possible issues that could have been
raised.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}

A fantasy card game was developed using object-oriented programming
(OOP) to store its cards\textquoteright{} data. A card can either
be a minion or a weapon. Each card has a name, mana cost, health or
durability and attack power. 

In order to play a card, a player must spend a certain amount of mana
as specified in the card\textquoteright s mana cost. When the card
has been played, the player may decide whether to use it to attack
another minion or not. 

A minion may belong to one of the following races: beast, demon, dragon
or elemental. When a minion is attacked, its health would decrease
according to the attacking card\textquoteright s attack power. Once
the health of a minion decreases to zero, it is destroyed and removed
from the game. 

Instead of health, a weapon has durability and it cannot be attacked.
When a weapon is used for an attack, its durability would decrease
by one. Once the durability of a weapon decreases to zero, it is destroyed
and removed from the game.

During a contact tracing exercise, the TraceTogether token\textquoteright s
tag number, the user\textquoteright s name and the user\textquoteright s
mobile number are stored in an Abstract Data Type (ADT) \texttt{Person}.
The information are stored as a three element tuple as follows: 
\noindent \begin{center}
\texttt{(tag: INTEGER, name: STRING, hp: STRING) }
\par\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.1 }

Write program code to implement the ADT \texttt{Person} with the above
constructor and accessors.\hfill{} {[}4{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.2 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{read\_file()} to read
all the 21 users\textquoteright{} information from the file \texttt{PEOPLE.csv}
and return a list containing all the \texttt{Person} ADTs.\hfill{}
{[}5{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 1.3 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{insertion\_sort(lst)}
that takes the list \texttt{lst} obtained from \textbf{Task 1.2} and
sort them according to their tag numbers in an ascending order using
the insertion sort algorithm.\hfill{} {[}5{]}

Searching for a tag number in a large list of users may be slow and
tedious. However, if the list is sorted, performing a binary search
would be more efficient. 

\subsubsection*{Task 1.4 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{search(lst,num)} that
searches for a tag number \texttt{num} in the sorted list \texttt{lst}
obtained from \textbf{Task 1.3}. The code should 
\begin{itemize}
\item perform a binary search on the sorted list. 
\item return the \texttt{Person} ADT if the tag number \texttt{num} exists.
Otherwise, return \texttt{None}. 
\item print the number of comparisons made in the searching process.\hfill{}

Every user is required to carry a tracing token inside an indoor sports
facility so that the sensing device system can detect the token to
read the position of the users and their temperature. The data is
stored as records in the file \texttt{POSRECORDS.txt}, with the following
entries separated by commas: 
\begin{itemize}
\item the tag number (\texttt{INTEGER}) of the tracing token which could
be used to identify the user 
\item the temperature (\texttt{FLOAT}) of the user measured in degree Celsius 
\item the location $(x,y)$\texttt{ (FLOAT,FLOAT)} of the user which consists
of the perpendicular \texttt{x-} and \texttt{y-}distances, measured
in metres, from the walls A and B respectively 
\end{itemize}
The diagram below shows two locations $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$:

The distance between two locations can be calculated using the formula: 

\[
\text{Distance}=\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}
\]


\subsubsection*{Task 2.1 }

Create an empty array \texttt{all\_records} of size 20 and paste the
data from the text file \texttt{POSRECORDS.txt} into your program
code. 

Write program code for the function \texttt{distance(user1,user2)}
that takes in two records and returns the distance between the two
users in metres, correct to 2 decimal places. \hfill{} {[}3{]}

For safety reasons during the Covid-19 pandemic, two users are considered
to be in close proximity if the distance between them is less than
1.5 m apart. 

\subsubsection*{Task 2.2 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{analyse(user1)} that iterates
through all the records in the array \texttt{all\_records}, calculates
the distances between \texttt{user1} and all other users in the array,
and returns a list of tag numbers of the users who are in close proximity
to \texttt{user1}. \hfill{} {[}5{]}

Under the Safe Management Measures, people with a temperature of more
than 37.5 degree Celsius will be flagged out as RED cases and the
people who are in close proximity to these RED cases will be flagged
out as YELLOW cases. The facility manager needs to submit both lists
to the authority daily for follow-up actions. 

\subsubsection*{Task 2.3 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{red\_list(all\_records)}
that iterates through all the records in the array \texttt{all\_records}
and returns a list of tag numbers belonging to the RED cases. \hfill{}
{[}2{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 2.4 }

Write program code for the function \texttt{yellow\_list(red\_cases,all\_records)}
that iterates through all the records in the array \texttt{all\_records}
to check for people who were in close proximity to any of the RED
cases. The function returns a list of tag numbers belonging to the
YELLOW cases. 

Those people flagged out as RED cases in \textbf{Task 2.3} should
not appear in the list of YELLOW cases even though they may be in
close proximity to another RED case. 

You may use the functions written in Task 2.1 and Task 2.2 for the
program code in this task. \hfill{} {[}5{]}

Lessonology is a learning management system that utilises gamification
elements to motivate students to complete their assignments. The Linked
List data structure is used to store the students\textquoteright{}
names and their total experience points. Each node contains a student\textquoteright s
name, the student\textquoteright s total experience points, and a
pointer to the next node. The nodes are linked together according
to the order provided in the \texttt{DATA.txt} file. 

A program is to be written to implement nodes as an instance of the
class \texttt{Node}. The class \texttt{Node} has the following properties
and method:

\subsubsection*{Task 4.1 }

Write program code for the classes \texttt{Node} and \texttt{StudentList},
including the \texttt{Constructor},\texttt{ Add() }and \texttt{Display()}
methods. The code should follow the specification given. Do not write
the \texttt{Update()} and \texttt{Delete()} methods yet. 

The \texttt{Add(node)} method for the \texttt{StudentList} class should
add the \texttt{node} containing a student\textquoteright s name and
the student\textquoteright s total experience points to the linked
list, according to the order given in the \texttt{DATA.txt} file. 

Test your code by reading the data from the file \texttt{DATA.txt}

\texttt{name} and the awarded \texttt{points} as inputs to update
the student\textquoteright s total experience points in the node.
(You may assume that the node containing the student exists in the
linked list.) 

For example, \texttt{Update('BRIAN',100)} will update the total experience
points of a student whose name is \texttt{'BRIAN'} from \texttt{20404}
to \texttt{20504}. \hfill{}{[}3{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 4.3 }

Write program code to implement the \texttt{Delete(name)} method for

a particular student\textquoteright s \texttt{name}, in the linked
list. Return \texttt{True} if the node is found and removed; otherwise
return \texttt{False}. (You may assume that the students\textquoteright{}
names are unique in the linked list.) \hfill{}{[}4{]}

\subsubsection*{Task 4.4 }

Another linked list which has pointers linking the nodes in decreasing

\texttt{Update()} & Modify the \texttt{Update()} method in the parent class such that
the linked list is still in decreasing order of experience points
after updating a student\textquoteright s total experience points.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{DisplayTop()} & Display the content of the nodes in the linked list for the top students
based on their total experience points.\tabularnewline

Write program code for the class \texttt{Leaderboard} to inherit the
properties and methods from the class \texttt{StudentList} with the
modified \texttt{Add()} and \texttt{Update()} methods. The additional
\texttt{DisplayTop(n)} method should display the top \texttt{n} number
of students in the linked list, based on their total experience points.
(You may assume that no two students have the same total experience
points.) 

Test your code by reading the data from the file \texttt{DATA.txt}
