Dubbed first of its kind globally, the Singapore Quick Response Code (SGQR) is an infrastructure-light technology that will help to simplify QR e-payments in Singapore for both consumers and merchants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SGQR is based on the QR Code Specification for Payment System - Merchant-Presented Mode standard issued by EMVCo, which has the benefits of international interoperability, multi-tenancy of QR schemes and non-sensitive data presented for payments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the specification, the parsed SGQR text string contains data items, with each data item adhering to the following structure: id, length, value. Two such data items are highlighted in bold in the following diagram:

The Viola-Jones object detection algorithm, named after two computer vision researchers Paul Viola and Michael Jones, uses integral images to detect the presence of facial features in an image efficiently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An integral image (also known as a summed-area table) is the name of both a data structure and an algorithm used to obtain this data structure. It uses a quick and efficient way to calculate the sum of pixel values in a rectangular part of an image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an integral image, the value of each point is the sum of all pixels above and to the left, including the target pixel:

Note that subtracting both B and C means that the area defined with A has been subtracted twice, so we need to add it back again.

The manager of a private carpark wants to process the daily data of people using the carpark. The carpark is open from 8am to 11pm and the carpark charge is as follows: 
\end_layout

Before 5pm: $1.50 per hour or part thereof

However, if a car enters before 5pm and leaves after 5pm, the charge involves both rules. For example, if the car stays in the carpark from 2.45pm to 6.30pm, it is broken down to 2 hours 15 minutes before 5pm and 1 hour 30 minutes after 5pm. Hence the charge will be $1.50 * 3 + $3.00 = $7.50.

\begin_layout Standard
JP Medical Centre uses a priority queue to register patients who visit for medical attention. Upon registration at the medical centre, each patient will be assigned a priority number according to the urgency in seeking medical care. The urgent cases receive top priority and go directly to the front of the queue, whereas the minor cases are added to the bottom of the queue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A priority queue is an extension of queue with the following properties. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every element has a priority associated with it. Higher priority has a larger number. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An element with high priority leaves the queue before an element with low priority. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue, i.e. the earlier element will be served before the later element (FIFO). 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of operations on a priority queue is shown below:

When a customer orders goods over the phone, the cashier will record the order in an order form containing the items ordered and quantity, customer address, delivery date and time and the amount payable. A copy of this form will be given to the storeman who will pick the goods and generate a delivery order (DO). The DO will be given to the delivery man who will deliver the goods. The customer on collecting the goods will sign on the DO and return a signed copy to the delivery man. On his return, the delivery man will give the DO to the accounts department who will generate an invoice. Invoices are kept in a file until the next day where they will be mailed to the customers.

EAN-13 (European Article Number) barcode a standard describing a barcode symbology and numbering system used in global trade to identify a specific retail product type, in a specific packaging configuration, from a specific manufacturer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EAN check digits are calculated by summing each of the odd position numbers multiplied by 3 and then by adding the sum of the even position numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numbers are examined going from right to left, so the first odd position is the last digit in the code. The final digit of the result is subtracted from 10 to calculate the check digit.

You are required to write a program code to generate a minesweeper grid, randomly position the bombs and populate all the other cells with the values indicating the number of bombs in the neighbouring cells. Without revealing the minesweeper grid to the player, the program should prompt the player to select the cells one by one. His score will be the number of cells opened before hitting a bomb.

On 14 September 2020, it was reported that GrabCar was fined S$10,000 for a 4th user data privacy violation. The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) said the update risked the personal data of 21,541 drivers and passengers, including profile pictures, names and vehicle plate numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GrabCar rolled back the app to the previous version within about 40 minutes and took other remedial action, PDPC said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Aug 30, 2019, GrabCar notified the PDPC that profile data of 5,651 GrabHitch drivers was exposed to the risk of unauthorised access by other GrabHitch drivers for a 
\begin_inset Quotes qld
\end_inset

short period of time on the same day
\begin_inset Quotes qrd
\end_inset

 through the Grab app.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grab's investigations traced the cause of the breach to a deployment of an update to the app on the same day. The purpose of the update was to address a potential vulnerability discovered within the Grab app.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In PDPC's findings, the application programming interface URL which allowed GrabHitch drivers to access their data, had contained a 
\begin_inset Quotes qld
\end_inset

userID
\begin_inset Quotes qrd
\end_inset

 portion that could potentially be manipulated to allow access to other drivers' data. According to GrabCar, there was no evidence that this vulnerability was exploited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fix the vulnerability, the update removed the 
\begin_inset Quotes qld
\end_inset

userID
\begin_inset Quotes qrd
\end_inset

 from the URL, which shortened it to a hard-coded 
\begin_inset Quotes qld
\end_inset

users/profile
\begin_inset Quotes qrd
\end_inset

. However, it failed to take into account the URL-based caching mechanism in the app, which was configured to refresh every 10 seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mechanism served cached content in response to data requests, so as to reduce the load of direct access to GrabCar's database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the update, all URLs in the Grab app ended with 
\begin_inset Quotes qld
\end_inset

users/profile
\begin_inset Quotes qrd
\end_inset

. Without the 
\begin_inset Quotes qld
\end_inset

userID
\begin_inset Quotes qrd
\end_inset

 in the URL, which directed data requests to the correct GrabHitch driver's accounts, the caching mechanism could no longer differentiate between drivers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the mechanism provided the same data to all GrabHitch drivers for 10 seconds before new data was retrieved from GrabCar's database and cached for the next 10 seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PDPC said GrabCar did not put in place 
\begin_inset Quotes qld
\end_inset

sufficiently robust processes
\begin_inset Quotes qrd
\end_inset

 to manage changes to its IT system that may put personal data it was processing at risk.

\begin_layout Standard
On 28 June 2020, nearly 10,000 TraceTogether tokens were distributed to vulnerable seniors. The TraceTogether token supplements the TraceTogether mobile app by extending contact tracing to groups in the community who do not have smart phones and those whose phones do not work well with the TraceTogether app.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TraceTogether token is designed to capture proximity data based on Bluetooth signals. Every five minutes, it scans to detect other TraceTogether users on the token or the app. The more 'hits' between two TraceTogether users, the more likely they are in close proximity for an extended period of time. Proximity can be estimated by the strength of the Bluetooth signal. The closer users are to one another, the stronger the signal and vice versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are only four types of data contained in the token: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
user's randomised ID 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
randomised ID of any other user in proximity 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bluetooth signal measured using RSSI* 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
timestamp of the encounter. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
*Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is a measure of the power level at the receiver. A more negative number indicates a device is further away. For example, a value of -20 to -30 indicates a device is close while a value of -120 indicates it is near the limit of detection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that these IDs do not refer to NRIC number, but randomised and anonymised IDs linked to a personal identifier like a mobile number. Also, no data is extracted unless a user has tested positive for COVID-19. From there, MOH has a special software key that can unlock the device and reveal the data for use in contact tracing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A senior is tested positive for COVID-19 and MOH needs to perform contact tracing. With the user's permission, data from its TraceTogether token is retrieved and extracted to the file 
\family typewriter
TOKEN.txt
\family default
 and has the following structure:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
UserRandomisedID, OtherRandomisedID, RSSI, Timestamp

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Task 1.1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prolonged exposure is currently defined as being in close contact for at least 15 minutes within a single session. For simplicity, you may assume close contact as a Bluetooth signal strength of greater than or equal to -30. Generate the list of close contacts' randomised IDs which MOH needs to perform contact tracing.

\family typewriter
is_close_contact(rid1, rid2)
\family default
 to determine if they are close contacts of 57345286. If yes, your function should also return the date(s) they are under prolonged exposure with each other, the start and end times as well as the total time in hours and minutes they are in close contact.

\begin_layout Standard
Write a program that sorts a list of student last names, but the sort only uses the first two letters of the name. Nothing else in the name is used for sorting. However, if two names have the same first two letters, they should stay in the same order as in the input (this is known as a 'stable sort'). Sorting is case sensitive based on ASCII order (with uppercase letters sorting before lowercase letters i.e. A<B<…<Z<a<b<…<z).
\end_layout

Input 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 last names made up of only letters (a–z, lowercase or uppercase), one name per line. Names have between 2 and 20 letters. Input ends when

Run-length encoding is a simple data compression technique that can be effective when repeated values occur at adjacent positions within a string. Compression is achieved by replacing groups of repeated values with one copy of the value, followed by the number of times the value should be repeated. For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
AAAAABBBAAAB
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be compressed as

Car owners who wish to purchase or renew their insurance policy with XYZ Motor Insurance are required to accumulate not more than 6 demerit points in their driving records. Under this demerit points system, a driver who clocks up more than 20 demerit points will have his/her driving license revoked, thus denying the person from driving and from purchasing any vehicle insurance. Drivers who have not made any insurance claims for the past 3 years can get 2 demerit points off, and current employees of XYZ Motor Insurance can get 1 demerit point deducted. In addition, drivers awarded with certificate of merit can get 1 demerit point off as well. XYZ Motor Insurance only allows drivers to receive a maximum deduction of 3 demerit points per year. Draw a decision table to reflect the eligibility of car owners who wish to purchase or renew a car insurance policy with XYZ Motor Insurance.

A binary tree is used to represent this coding system. Each node, except the root node, contains a letter of the alphabet. The position of each letter in the tree is determined by its Morse code. Moving from one node to another down the tree is done by traversing either a left branch or a right branch. A left branch corresponds to a . (dot) and a right branch corresponds to a – (dash).

A hash table has 8 spaces to store strings, indexed from 1 to 8 inclusive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hash function finds the ASCII number of the first letter of the string, then counts the number of 1s in its binary representation. This is the index in which the string will be inserted into the hash table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the string

Instead, the data security company waits until the next time the database is due for scheduled maintenance to attempt to fix the vulnerability.

A file compression algorithm reduces file sizes so that files can be sent more quickly. One such algorithm is the Huffman algorithm for text files, which will be implemented in this task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Unlike ASCII, which assigns a fixed size of 8 bits for each character, the Huffman algorithm assigns fewer bits to more common characters and more bits to less common characters. For example, in a long text written in English, characters such as '
\family typewriter
e
\family default
' and '
\family typewriter
t
\family default
' will have fewer bits assigned to them than characters such as '
\family typewriter
q
\family default
' and '
\family typewriter
z
\family default
'. If the text is long enough, this will use fewer bits in total to encode the text compared to ASCII.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
To know which sequence of bits to encode for each character, the 
\series bold
frequency

 of each character, which is the number of times each character appears in the text file, is tabulated.

s takeover of Afghanistan had seen the United States (US) evacuating people. The Republic of Singapore Air Force offers its A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport plane (A330 MRTT) to help the US airlift groups of evacuees from Afghanistan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Task 1.1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prevent Taliban interference, messages sent between evacuees and the A330 MRTT are encrypted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The encryption converts each character of the message into its ASCII number representation, adds the ASCII number representation of a character of a secret key which is in the same position, and then converts it back into ASCII text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secret keys are generated from passwords known only by the sender and receiver. Passwords that are shorter in length than the message are lengthened to match by repeating the password until the same length as the message is achieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, given that the inputs are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

password :

\begin_inset Quotes qrd
\end_inset

 -> 99, 97, 116, 99, 97 
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 3 - Add the ASCII number representation of same positions together
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
104+99, 101+97, 108+116, 108+99, 111+97 -> 203, 198, 224, 207, 208

The task is to implement a priority queue using Object-Oriented Programming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A priority queue is an extension of queue with the following properties. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every element has a priority associated with it. Smaller integer value has a higher priority. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An element with high priority leaves the queue before an element with low priority. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue, i.e. the earlier element will be served before the later element (FIFO). 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the emergency room in a hospital assigns patients with priority numbers. The patient with the highest priority is treated first, regardless of the order of arrival.

The task is to write program code for a Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek game for two players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek is a game played on a 4 x 4 square board. The board starts empty, except that a single 'T' symbol may appear in one of the 16 squares. There are two players: X and O. They take turns to make moves, with X starting. In each move a player puts her symbol in one of the empty squares. Player X's symbol is 
\family typewriter
'X'
\family default
, and player O's symbol is 
\family typewriter
'O'
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a player's move, if there is a row, column or a diagonal containing 4 of that player's symbols, or containing 3 of her symbols and the 
\family typewriter
'T'
\family default
 symbol, she wins and the game ends. Otherwise the game continues with the other player's move. If all of the fields are filled with symbols and nobody won, the game ends in a draw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the 4 x 4 board description containing 
\family typewriter
'X'
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
'O'

 characters (where

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each unused node that are not in the logical BST is initially connected in a singly linked list manner using the
