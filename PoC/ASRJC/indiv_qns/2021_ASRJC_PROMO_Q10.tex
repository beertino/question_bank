Fig. 1 shows the cylindrical-shaped water pipe, with negligible thickness
and open on both ends, inscribed in a hemisphere with fixed radius
8 cm. The cross sectional view of the pipe and the hemisphere is shown
in Fig. 2. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the diameter of the pipe is $x$ cm, show that the curved surface
area, S, of the pipe is $2\pi x\sqrt{64-x^{2}}$ $\text{cm}^{2}$.
\hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item It is given that as $x$ varies, the maximum value of $S$ occurs
when the ratio of the diameter of the pipe to its height is $1:k$.
Find the exact value of $k$ and the exact maximum value of $S$.\hfill{}

\item A particle is moving on the curve with equation $y=2\sin^{-1}(3x),-\frac{1}{3}\le x\le\frac{1}{3},$
where $(x,y)$ is the coordinate of the particle at time $t$ relative
to a fixed point $O$. The $x$ and $y$ values represent the horizontal
and vertical displacements. When the $y$-coordinate of the particle
is $\frac{\pi}{3}$, the rate at which the $y$-coordinate is decreasing
with time $t$ is 2 units per second. At this instant, find the exact
rate at which the $x$-coordinate of the particle changes with time.
