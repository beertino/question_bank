The curve C has equation 

\[
y=\frac{4x^{2}+px-q}{x^{2}-s},\text{ }x\in\mathbb{R},\text{ }x^{2}\ne s
\]

where $p$, $q$ and $s$ are non-zero constants. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is given that $C$ passes through the point $\left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$
and has a vertical asymptote $x=2$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item State the value of $s$ and show that the value of $q$ is 2. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item It is given further that the line $y=1$ is a tangent to $C$ and
it does not meet the curve again. Find the exact value of $p$ if
$p$ is a negative real value. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item It is now given instead that $p=4,\text{ }q=-1\text{ and }s=1$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch the curve $C$, showing clearly the coordinates of any turning
point(s), equations of any asymptotes and the coordinates of any points
of intersection with the axes. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Find the equation of the additional curve that needs to be added to
the curve sketched in (b)(i) to determine the number of distinct real
roots for the equation $10(x+2)^{2}=3\left(10-\left(\frac{(4x^{2}+4x+1)}{(x^{2}-1)}\right)^{2}\right)$.
