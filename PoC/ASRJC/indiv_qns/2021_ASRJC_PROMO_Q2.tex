A graph with the equation $y=\frac{3}{x^{2}+2}$ undergoes, in succession,
the following transformations: 

$A$: A translation of 1 unit in the direction of the negative $x$-axis. 

$B$: A scaling parallel to the $x$-axis by a scale factor of $\frac{1}{3}$. 

$C$: A reflection in the $y$-axis. 

Determine the equation of the resulting curve. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
