A curve \$y=\textbackslash frac\{2\}\{\{\{x\}\textasciicircum\{2\}\}-3\}\$
undergoes, in succession, the following transformations, where a and
b are positive constants. A: A translation of a units in the negative
x-direction. B: A reflection about the y-axis. C: A scaling parallel
to the y-axis with scale factor of b. The equation of the resultant
curve is \$y=\textbackslash frac\{6\}\{\{\{x\}\textasciicircum\{2\}\}-10x+22\}\$.
Find the values of a and b. {[}3{]}
