Relative to the origin O, the points A, B and C have position vectors
\textbackslash{[}2\textbackslash mathbf\{u\}-3\textbackslash mathbf\{v\},\textbackslash{]}\textbackslash{[}\textbackslash mathbf\{u\}+2\textbackslash mathbf\{v\}\textbackslash{]}and
\textbackslash{[}3\textbackslash mathbf\{u\}-2\textbackslash mathbf\{v\}\textbackslash{]}respectively,
where u and v are two non-zero and non-parallel vectors. (i) Show
that the area of triangle ABC is given by \$3\textbackslash left|
\textbackslash mathbf\{u\}\textbackslash times \textbackslash mathbf\{v\}
\textbackslash right|.\$ {[}3{]}

It is given that \$\textbackslash mathbf\{u\}=2\textbackslash mathbf\{i\}-\textbackslash mathbf\{j\}+2\textbackslash mathbf\{k\}\$
and \$\textbackslash mathbf\{v\}=3\textbackslash mathbf\{i\}-4\textbackslash mathbf\{j\}-p\textbackslash mathbf\{k\},\$
where p is a constant. 

(ii) If the area of triangle ABC is \$15\textbackslash sqrt\{53\}\$
square units, find the possible values of p exactly. {[}4{]}

(iii) It is given that the angle between vectors u and v is acute.
Find this angle, giving your answer in degrees. Explain why there
is only one answer. {[}3{]}
