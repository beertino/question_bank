The diagram shows the curve$y=\text{f}(x)$. There are two vertical
asymptotes with equations $x=-2$ and $x=2$ respectively. The curve
crosses the $x$-axis at the point $A$ and has a maximum turning
point at $B$ where it crosses the $y$-axis. 

The curve also has a minimum turning point at $C$. The coordinates
of $A$, $B$ and $C$ are $(a,0)$, $(0,-10)$ and $(p,q)$ respectively,
where $a$, $p$ and $q$ are constants. 

Sketch the following curves and state the equations of the asymptotes,
the coordinates of the turning points and of points where the curve
crosses the axes, if any. Leave your answers in terms of $a$, $p$
or $q$ where necessary. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]  $y=\frac{1}{\text{f}(x)}$, and \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item[(ii)]  $y=\text{f}(2-|x|)$. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
